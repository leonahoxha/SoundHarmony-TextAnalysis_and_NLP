XM5 have similar bass profile but more upper mids/treble which would take away that muffle and add clarity. They are still mid-bassy but you can just drop that a touch in the EQ in the app, dropping the first 400Hz by even 1-2dB helps with that. My XM4, -1dB is enough, some of them seem to measure bassier and you might want 2. It's a small change but it removes all the bass bloom/boom for me.

On the EQ, the app isn‚Äôt great. To your point, it doesn‚Äôt let you adjust by frequency until 400Hz, which is really lower mids.

The XM5s are definitely a bit more firm, partially because the tips are foam versus silicone/rubber, and they go slightly deeper into the ear. They definitely stay in my ears better than the AirPods. I can dance around in them no issue. 

However, I still would not say they are great for working out, and for this, the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 are the better choice. This is because along with multiple tips, they also include wings to provide stability against the back part of your ear. They are my primary workout buds.

And then just that if you do feel the mid-bass is a *little* too much, -1 or -2dB at 400Hz really cleans it up a lot. I get that the 400Hz is limiting but it has a Q either side and I find this one effectively brings down the mid-bass and the bleed into the lower mids.

Automatic connection switching between your devices. XM5s only support two connections, so if you‚Äôre like me and have a phone, tablet, computer, TV, etc., then you‚Äôre constantly repairing across devices. 

Spatial audio (including personalized for your ears and head tracking) that is embedded in the OS, so it works with only a couple of clicks. With the XM5s you have to enable a bunch of stuff in the Sony app (which requires signing up for an account), then turning on the setting in individual apps. Also iOS only supports spatial audio for video with AirPods and a Beats, so for video you simply won‚Äôt have the option. 

Transparency mode that automatically blocks out loud noises. XM5s don‚Äôt have this. ANC mode that automatically lets in voices (coming in iOS 17).  XM5s have this but it is imbedded within the app settings.

However, what you‚Äôre trying to do in general (block out voices) is very tough for all devices in general. 

If you think about how ANC works, in simple terms, it hears what‚Äôs around you and blasts opposing frequencies into your ears to cancel out the noise. This is though to do for vocal frequencies because it‚Äôs the same area of the frequency spectrum that‚Äôs important for music. That‚Äôs why ANC is better at low rumbles (planes, HVACs,) and high pitched frequencies. I‚Äôve yet to come across any device that can block out people while nothing is playing.

I get that the APP has a lot of tech. I love that you can switch between passthrough audio and ANC in the span of 2-3 seconds; I do this when I transition between public transit and walking outdoors. Wireless is convenient, too - nothing to tangle or yank. 

But there are two factors I‚Äôve encountered that make me hesitate to upgrade. Firstly, when I am out of my home, sound quality automatically takes a hit because of the environmental noises. That can‚Äôt be helped unless I wear Etymotics, but those isolate too well and take away situational awareness. 

Secondly, wireless interference is a thing. I don‚Äôt own a car so I take public transit when going to places. When the bus or train is packed, especially during rush hour, I notice a fair bit of audio clipping.

You can avoid it with earbuds that *don't* seal (like the non-pro Airpods, or Galaxy Beans). But they have severe compromise in the sound quality and huge bass roll-off in particular. I would pick something like that if I had to use a headset for making calls where I had to talk though.",blorg,1.0

You can vary it a bit with tips, Tangzu Tang Sancai for example have a textured skin that is designed to slightly break the seal and relieve ear pressure. The trade-off is lower perceived bass intensity (but some IEMs are too bassy as is, so this can be a positive with some).

* Mid and high bass are fine, but low bass rolls off from 30hz to 20hz, just like the XM4's. SoundGuys.com (and Rtings.com XM4) frequency chart confirms this. 20hz is where you get the deep seat-rumbling type of bass. If you listen to a lot of hip-hop or Altanta Trap from producers like Metro Boomin', you're going to prefer the bass of the MTW3's. But if you listen to other music where the bass isn't the star of the show, you might prefer the more accurate treble of the XM5's. - The low bass line to Beyonce's ""Heated"" is mostly missing behind the rest of the sounds. Or listening to the second half of Kanye West's ""Say You Will"" from 808 and Heartbreaks, or the intro to Nipsey Hussle's Blue Laces 2 shows how in comparison to the MTW3's, there's not as much ""rumble"" to the low bass. The XM5's definitely have a lot and enough bass, but it's just missing that x-factor that I'm looking for.
* Music doesn't sound as immersive, maybe due in part to the missing low-end bass. If the star of the show is missing, you can't really enjoy the music. But overall, the soundstage feels smaller.
* The XM5's definitely sound better than I remember the XM4's sounding. The treble is not muddy.
* The small eartips do not fully seal my ear, and the medium ear tips seem too big to really get into my ear. I tried the squeeze and insert method where you compress the foam and try to insert it into your ears before it expands. This didn't work well. The fit never really feels secure. I don't think it's realistic to workout with these on. Like if you're eating and your jaw is moving, anticipate the seal slowly degrading and being compromised.
* While the XM5's do sound OK out of the box, they do not EQ well. It doesn't seem like bass can really be improved from out of the box. Soundstage cannot be fixed. If not for the lack of bass I'd probably be content with the overall sound. The Sennheiser's have a ""My Sound"" Personalized EQ feature that is easily customizable and just absolutely kills the XM5's because you can really fine tune the EQ in an intuitive way that helps you get the earbuds to sound like how you want them to sound. The Sony's do have a custom EQ wizard, but it's just not as good and doesn't impact the actual sound as much.",None,2.0
