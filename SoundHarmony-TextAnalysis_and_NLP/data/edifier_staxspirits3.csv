edifier stax spirit s3,headphones,Edifier Stax Spirit S3 Review,vhc4q9,the_bad_fish_2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/vhc4q9,104,46,1655816556.0,"Here are my initial thoughts/review of the Audeze LCD-1 wireless, aka Stax S3.

Unboxing - I hate unboxing. Boxes are for shoe collectors. Look at Beats. What good is a good box if the product is junk? The box to this is covered in Stax branding, which is odd because of topics I will touch on later. Inside the box was another box with another box and a sleeve with the headphone case and the headphones. Too much packaging. I care about the environment. There is so much waste in this useless packaging. Want to impress me? Make a good product.

Travel Case - My legal team is telling me I can't call it the same case as the Audeze LCD-1 with a Stax logo. I posted pictures. You decide. It is a nice hard case with minimal branding. The inside has a non-expanding mesh with a small (1 in) Velcro strip to hold it shut. There is a felt center divider to keep the ear cups separate, which is terrible. It feels low quality and doesn't serve a purpose. Overall 8/10.

Build - Do you have Audeze LCD-1? That is how they feel. The headband is the same. The pads are the same. It does come with earpads that match the case look but are probably the softest earpads. They are really comfortable. The pads are the same 4 plastic clip design as the LCD-1. Easy to change out. Mostly, the build is plastic with a metal adjustment band inside the plastic. Not bad. There is a 3.5 mm jack on one side for when the electronics eventually die. Above average build. 7/10

Comfort - These are heavier than the LCD-1. This is to include the wireless bits and the batteries. I used them for 4 hours straight without any discomfort. I was using the soft pads and not the leather pads. I didn't get the headband pain and clamping force was solid without being too tight. It is closed back so they could get hot with the leather pads. Since I haven't tested this, I won't comment more on it. 9/10

Wireless Features - I didn't know what to call this. This is why you would pick a wireless headphone over wired. This has an 80 hour battery life, which is impressive. I think the standard is closer to 20 hours on overear. My Sony XM4 is close to that. I have the Grado GW100v2 that are 20-ish. Unlike the XM4, there is no noise cancelling. There is a lot of leak, especially at high volumes. It has three buttons, which control everything. No touch controls are present. The buttons do a lot, but it is so much I'll probably never use it. The start up voice is the standard trash voice that non-descriptive BLE headphones have. When not playing music, there is a hiss. It is noticeable. It uses Aptx-HD, which isn't LDAC quality but is better than average for bit rate. Overall, the features are a let down. 2/10

Sound Quality - They sound okay. Better than most BLE headphones, but that is a low bar to clear. I know that I'm not legally allowed to say they are closed back wireless LCD-1, even though I did say that at the beginning. These do not sound as good as the LCD-1. They sound alright. In the audiophile world, I give them a solid ""meh"" out of 10. They will do. Desert island headphones. I like the LCD-1. I am an Audeze fanboy though. My gaming headphones are the LCD-GX. Good headphones. The LCD-1 are great for their price. These don't sound like closed back LCD-1. They do sound like planars. The bass goes low without being boomy. They are fast. They just aren't amazing, which they should be for the price. They sound average for wireless and below average for audiophile headphones. I stick with before. Meh/10

Oddities - Now that everything else is out of the way, I wanted to cover the strangeness of these headphones. Why do they look identical to the LCD-1? Was this to save on cost? If so, why are they $399? These are not $399 headphones. These are $250 headphones. At $399, you are above the big wireless hitters. Sony and Bose make better headphones, as far as wireless features, than this. Why does the case say Stax but the headphone say Edifier. Who is Edifier? I know someone will comment with the detailed history of Edifier and call me a know-nothing for not knowing who they are. I have never heard of them before these. Why call them Stax if you aren't branding the actual product as Stax? 

Overall, these miss the mark. There are so many other wireless headphones you can get for the price. I'm comparing them as wireless because that is what they are. I purchased these to be a competitor to my XM4. I'm leaving to CT next week. On the plane, I was going to take these. I'll probably take my XM4. These are not Stax. These are not Audeze. These are Edifier. Above average wireless headphones priced too high. For $399, you could get the XM4 on sale for $350, a Wendy's spicy chicken sandwich, and gas. If these were $250, I would say pick them up.

This is my first audio review. It is a little rant-y but that is what I'm like. Thanks for reading.",the_bad_fish_2,33.0

Almost comes across as a parody of Stax (I haven't heard a ""proper"" Stax, but from my imagination- bright and bassless).

On the default profile though, these are very well tuned.

Actually quite similar to the AKG N700NCM2 BUT with the bass reined in so it's not boomy, and more detail. Very close to Harman. Better tuned than the N700, which was itself well tuned. The bass is very good, it's there, there is a Harman-level shelf, with a little more mid-bass (I can take that), but *not too much*, and it extends really well into the sub-bass as well.

https://vsg.squig.link/?share=Harman_Combined_Over-Ear_Target,Edifier_STAX_SPIRIT_S3_Lambskin_BT,Edifier_STAX_SPIRIT_S3_Mesh_BT,Sennheiser_x_Drop_HD_6XX

On initial listen, with some tracks I get a bit of sharpness in the treble. Many tracks there is none at all, it's very content dependent. I may get used to that. And the soundstage is pretty flat. While they are detailed there is a certain flatness to the way they sound. I have the Edition XS and the HD600 as well- the Edition XS sound a lot better. The HD600 sounds better too. 

I haven't heard the Sony XM4, but I suspect these sound a lot better than the Sony XM4. I can't imagine I could deal with the bass on the XM4. For me they are better than the N700 and a lot of that is the bass is better controlled.

They aren't very isolating at all though. Like they are a closed back, so they are much more isolating than an open back, but for a closed back, the isolation is pretty weak. I'm using the mesh/cooling gel pads which are much more comfortable than the leather ones. With these it's actually very comfortable. Dimension and fit wise, it's very similar to the N700. Fit is solid and secure, but there can be a bit of a creak with head/jaw movement, particularly if you wear glasses. This isn't at the level it's disqualifying, I get creak on the Edition XS as well. But it's definitely there.

Overall, I think they are compelling if you want a very well tuned Harman neutral wireless closed back, and want that one thing, and don't care about anything else, because they don't do anything else. I also paid Asian pricing for them, so closer to $200 than $400. I'd be less ecstatic at $400. But I can't imagine being happy with the likes of the XM4/XM5 or the Airpods Max at that price level either.",blorg,2.0

Audeze assure me that it's okay, and nothing to worry about. This is an copypaste from their site. 


""Since air is trapped between your head and the diaphragm it creates a pressure zone, and as the headphones shift with movement you may hear a slight crinkling sound from the diaphragm. This is a normal occurrence with planar magnetic drivers and is nothing to be concerned about, it's the sound of the thin diaphragm moving back and forth with the changes in air pressure.

Sometimes as the driver film stretches slightly with age, the sound can become more apparent, and sometimes it may also lessen again. This is mostly influenced by factors in your environment (such as temperature and humidity), and we don't have much control over whether or not this occurs.

One important note is that we strongly recommend exercising certain cautions when handling planar magnetic headphones: trapped air can create high pressure and sudden pressure changes could damage the diaphragms, and this is not covered by warranty. The same is true when you put the headphones on or take them off-- it's not a good idea to press them hard and fast against the head, so we recommend slow and steady movement to allow the air pressure to stabilize.""",Getagraxx,1.0

really? I searched just now and there does seem to be a few Spirit S3 posts with a decent amount of upvotes.

>Any idea why Edifier hasn’t tried to improve it?

anyway regarding App updates. is anything broken in the App?? if everything is running fine I don't really see a need to push an app update. (if the app/firmware is already great it can often be the case that a minor app update actually breaks an existing function)

if custom EQ is what you want, well I guess if it wasn't technically advertised to begin with they have no real obligation to add that feature. you never know though sometimes companies are responsive to feedback. but yeah I wouldn't hold my breath if it has been 1.5 years since you requested it.

There's really not much STAX in here aside from the part where Edifier decided to make a new product line called STAX SPIRIT, and the new S3 is the debut entry. It's not an e-stat (sorry, ear speakers) headphones but rather uses custom Audeze planar magnetic drivers and draws heavy inspirations from most of the LCD-1 design, accessory, and even the case owing to Edifier (1) owning STAX fully and (2) being a significant shareholder in Audeze.

You can also use a 5-band EQ we added, but the sound personalization feature can do some other tricks beyond EQ that makes percussion smack, bass bump, and anything else you prefer. Oh, and you can use them wired OR wirelessly, and even direct connect to a USB port on your computer to act as a DAC. Give 'em a try ;)",SennheiserOfficial,3.0

The Amanda BT are - in my opinion - probably your best bet seeing BT is not negociable, although they're a little beyond your current budget.

Having said that, is there a specific reason why you don't want a bluetooth dac/amp and wired headphones, and instead need something with BT built in?",wavecult,2.0

Thanks!  
So I've actually tried the wired (non-BT) Anandas (mentioned above) and thought they were nice but not sooo perfect that I could settle for the inability to custom EQ it to some degree. (I am painfully picky). I can't imagine the BT sounds better than the wired Anandas but I would SERIOUSLY consider it if it came alongside an app where I could EQ (not sure they do though). Maybe I should seriously consider regardless...

Also, yep!: my hesitation is that you can't custom EQ wired headphones, and at least the bluetooth dac/amps I've seen have very limited sound changing ability (the one I tried in store could boost bass or boost soundstage but that's it). I feel like I'm just too picky and neurotic to go without custom EQ. Other than that but less important, I prefer for them to be handsfree for dancing especially, but even just for multitasking, when I can't be holding my phone or the dac/amp and I've got no pockets.

(I suppose I could probably get a less expensive wired pair, but walked away from the gear store with the impression of like - oh man, that's \*two\* expensive pieces of gear now. Cause the seller recommended wired Anandas + ifi goBLU and I think they were something like $750 combined which is a LOT)",ao2541,1.0

You really don't need to EQ on the headphone-manufacturer's bluetooth app directly. What's your source going to be? If using a phone or pc you can always install a separate app to handle EQ or use the EQ functionality of your music player. You might want to look into that.

On the topic of bluetooth dac/amps and having no pockets, something like the Qudelix 5K (does it's job well, is small and light and doesn't break the bank) just clips on and has very detailed EQ controls. That's the kind of solution I was suggesting if you're not happy with any of the BT models.",wavecult,1.0
