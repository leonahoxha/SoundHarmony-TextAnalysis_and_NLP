Voice Detect doesn't really make sense for me, because most of the time, I'm approached by others in the workplace, so if they start to speak, Ambient Sound won't kick in and I need to ask them to repeat what they said.

The Pixel Buds Pro are a great alternative, especially considering they're 40% off right now, comfortable fit, custom EQ, better volume controls, and a great companion app even if you don't have a Pixel phone.

That's not to downplay the value of the Buds FE, for their MSRP, they're great, but they were missing a couple small features that turned out to be deal breakers for me, like having to choose between Sound Modes and volume controls for a long press control. Plus, the bass can be really loose and woofy, which I experienced on some tracks that put me off a bit. Otherwise, they are great, and were super comfortable.

You can also undercut the value of the Buds FE and go for something like the Soundcore Space A40, which has really good reviews.

If you're deadset on Galaxy Buds, I'd say start out with the Buds2 Pro to see if the fit/comfort works for you, because if they do, they're 100% the better and more features packed earbud. They didn't work out for me, but my wife loves them. If you can, buy from a store with a good return policy. If they don't work out, give the Buds FE a try.",zjb29877,3.0

Since then, I have used the buds Live and often I would straight up forget that I have a bud in one of my ears, because they let sound through pretty well and are very comfortable.

  


Recently I decided to get the 2 Pros, and while I don't think I'll fawn over how seamlessly they fit in my ears, I have had no issues with comfort (I had had some issue with the original buds Pro, if that tells you anything), they isolate noise very well with ANC, and primarily I ofc got them for sound quality. Another plus over the FEs is wireless charging (which is actually not relevant for me), and water resistance (which is very relevant for me).

  


Voice detect - I can't really think of any reason I'd use that feature, lol.

  


All in all, if you want some good sound depth and bass, try to look for a good deal on 2 pro, but if comfort is a concerning uncertainty for you, maybe see if you can try them on somewhere before buying. Try on FE while you're at it",KumoNin,1.0

The trick is foam ear tips. With the stock silicone tips, the sound is just too tinny and fatiguing and the ANC is just alright. But with foam ear tips, the lower end is much fuller and the tinny sounding highs are suppressed for a much more pleasing and comfortable sound. The ANC is also drastically improved due to the higher frequencies that they normally have a hard time with being cancelled by the foam.

The FE are just a more affoedable version, probably not even a better value as the Buds2 Pro can be had for barely over a hungie on Amazon right now. (Under if you opt for Amazon Renewed!)",xblackbeltninjax,1.0

I still don't think it's that easy to compare with the Buds2 Pro as it is in a different league on its own. However, these Buds FE does put the Pro to shame in more ways than one because it does what it should really well. ANC is surprisingly well executed, the sound quality from a single driver setup is very well done and the price for what they offer is just so good.

In case of 2's, I would feel them becoming loose on my way to work after around 10 minutes (which forced me to keep correcting them) and by the time I entered the office (\~30 minutes) they would often fall out (I do wear face mask while riding a bus, which can make the ear move a bit more).

I already did the same routine with FE's few times and so far, I didn't feel them becoming loose and they didn't fall out, sitting quite firmly within the ear.",revanmj,1.0

> The case will be similar to the Galaxy Buds2 and Buds2 Pro's, while the buds themselves are reminiscent of the Buds+ with a glossy touch area and rubber wingtips that will come in different sizes.

> According to previous reports, these buds will have a 12 mm driver for “improved bass reproduction”. The price is said to be under $100, and some retailers were spotted preparing for a sale of the Galaxy Buds FE at €88.90, which is even less.

The Buds 2 are the previous generation's budget model, and they have ANC.  Two generations ago, they had the Buds+, which had no ANC but a way, way longer battery.  Maybe they'll sacrifice the ANC to bring back the long battery?

I'd personally prefer the longer battery. I don't use ANC.

Keep in mind that there are plenty of top-end earbuds that don't have ANC, like from Sennheiser.  Not everyone wants that feature, even if they can afford it.",acidtoyman,18.0
