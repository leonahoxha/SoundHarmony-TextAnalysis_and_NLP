Cuz I turn on the Bluetooth on my iPhone first. So what I had to do was reset it by touching the magnetic ear loops back to the base on each earbud and then put them in the case and close the case. When you do this it resets them. Next, if you paired them already choose ""forget this device"" in Bluetooth. Now take each earbud out the case and put them on. You should hear the tone in each ear showing they have powered on. Next tape each ear but 3 times at the same time. Once they pair you will hear a piano tone in each ear. When you hear this, turn on your Bluetooth on your phone and find the device and connect. If it doesn't not connect, choose :forget this device"" again.

Whoever thought it was a good idea to design a headphone without a pairing button should be fired.

Not even an edit, as I was typing the left earbud's light stopped flickering and is now just charging. It was like that for about 5 hours, and I tried basically everything.

Now I can connect to them, but only the left one plays audio. It also shows on available devices two 'JBL ENDURANCE PEAK II-LE', when I try connecting it asks for a pin code. I'll try putting them back in their case for a while.
