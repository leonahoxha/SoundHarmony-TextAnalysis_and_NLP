I love the enhanced sub-bass you can dial up..    I added about +2 on the high treble side and that evened it out for me.    Sony's stock sound signature is always on the warm side.    If you're looking for probably the newest, lightest on-ear BT headphones, these are it..  Comfort isn't amazing but it's better than most around this price point.     These do go on sale for 39.99 in the states (they have twice so far) so if you can score that deal - it's a no brainer.     A tough decision for me was that the JBL BT510's are on sale for 29.99 right now but they are a bit long in the tooth (a few years old) without as many features as the new CH520s.    The EQ feature is a big win for the CH520 since the CH510s didn't have it.   Personally I was thinking the no-passive option was kind of a dealbreaker, these having over 50+ hours of battery life kind of makes you never have battery anxiety.   Back to sound quality my only gripe is that the stereo separation/sound stage is pretty flat and very inside your head but I guess that's to be expected at this price point.",Good_Honest_Jay,2.0

They seem pretty good to me, surprisingly for the price. I'm also kind of curious to see how the 720's sound as well.

One thing that really bugs me with several of the current high end ANC headphones is you can't shut off the ANC. That's the case with the Bose QC45 and the Sennheiser Momentum 4. Then others like AirPods Max you can't adjust it so it's either way too high or you get a lot of rumbling.

So it's nice to have the option of the 520's where it's light and fairly comfortable and sounds pretty good for both voice and music. And being only $60 and having long battery life is a huge plus. Also, having USB-C charging and EQ! Great features.",JarickL,2.0

But whatever the headphone Jack is outdated and I don’t need it on ps4 cause felt like speaker is better with tv. And I think this wireless gaming headphone has low latency that supports pc gaming.
Just overall I do not regret my purchase and I consider the most important point, which is to get headphones as soon as they are released because afterwards there will be many customer returns, defectives and secondhand scam even from official stores. So yes 60 bucks is not that much and there are way many comments and sources approving this pair of headphones so might as well risk it.",No_Run8454,2.0

It will lower things like people talking but it won't do anything like remove airplane wind noise or anything. It's definitely better than really open on ears but not like ANC over ears.

Previously, I was using the cheap JLab Rewind on ears that are about $20. Those were surprisingly nice in the ""bass boost"" setting for listening to podcasts without blocking sound.

It's surprisingly quite good!

I took a couple of work calls from them (Zoom, Teams). I can hear everyone crystal clear which is great. Sometimes really colored headphones result in muffled or tinny voices. These sound very good.

Took myself off of mute in a couple calls and everyone could hear me just fine, no complaints. I didn't ask about the quality or anything as they're big calls with a lot of people on them.

Then I just did a voice memo on my iPhone which I've taken with I think about every headphone I've used. Again, they're quite good which is unexpected! My voice sounds pretty clear, a little rolled off in the lows but not tinny.

Now it does sound like there's a noise gate so when I'm not speaking with a medium to loud voice it kind of cuts out a bit which is annoying.

To be clear it's not nearly as clear as the Bose 700 which are the best I've used. Or the Airpod Pros which are also fantastic. And they're probably a bit worse than the Sony XM4 and Airpod Max and others. I bet if you got into a noisy environment things would probably get worse too.

Q30 has an app so you can and must EQ it, otherwise sounds like garbage. Q30 is more comfortable being over ear instead of on-ear like the Sony's. Battery life is about the same with the Q30 anc off, otherwise q30 less battery life. If I had to chose again I'd go for the Sony's, they're less fragile, easier to transport, auto shutdown after 5 minutes off not being connected (Q30's take 30 minutes).",decipher90,1.0
