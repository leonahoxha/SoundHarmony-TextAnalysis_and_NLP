But you need to turn off some other functionality in order to get this to work.

So, I want to be able to play/pause, turn ANC on and off, AND be able to adjust the volume. Unfortunately I can't do that. I need to switch one fo the earbuds to control volume. Then I would lose either play/pause or ANC on and off.

The AirPods Pro let me click the stem to play/pause, long click to turn ANC on and off, and swipe up and down on the stem to adjust volume.

The swiping for volume is a new feature added to the AirPods Pro 2.

And an NRR rating is a rating continuous passive noise isolation. So, if your sound isolation device has an NRR rating of say 25, then it needs to provide 25 decibles of sound dampening when you wear them under all conditions.

With ANC, when you're only cancelling out loud noises when there is a loud noise, then you're not going to get an NRR rating. Though if your ANC device has passive noise cancellation through the use of foam tips or other passive devices, that should get an NRR rating.

And NRR rating is also a guarantee. ANC uses math to figure out what frequencies to cancel. They can't guarantee that you'll always get the same NRR rated reduction every time you use them,

if you REALLY need sound protection, I would not recommend you get ANC headphones/earbuds. Get the right tool for the job.

But if you want sound protection as an added feature in case you're walking about and something causes a very loud noise, such as walking buy a construction worker using a jack hammer, then using ANC for those 10-20 seconds as you walk past them is probably better than not having any hearing protection at all.

But I agree with you that using them instead of actual hearing protection on a regular basis is not a good idea.",plazman30,7.0

Soundproofing is always better than ANC. You are also moving the goal posts and/or trying to justify your position. You specifically mentioned lawnmower duty. That is an occupational and continuous noise. It’s not a jack hammer, passing train or loud car that lasts 10-15sec. ANC is neither approved nor recommended for occupational noise hazards as it doesn’t offer significant protection.",Capid1,1.0

Not only does the ANC on Airpods Pro muffle noise regardless of whether \*loud\* noise is present, it also has a transparency mode that will reduce the volume of \*sudden\* loud noises down to a manageable level, made possible by the new chip that is polling for such noises at 48000x per second.

But I mow the lawn once a week or once every 2 weeks. If I owned a landscaping business, there is no way i would use ANC as my noise protection.

I used to work in a lab and we wore ear protection in the dog rooms, because 16-24 barking dogs make a LOT of noise in an enclosed space. When you're doing that on a daily basis, ANC is not the answer.

You are right. I moved the goal posts, but I think I misunderstood what you were saying. Apple, in their literature, talks about the APP being able to filter out sudden loud noises that happen around you when you have them in. I think that might help protect your hearing to a small degree.

But I would never consider using ANC as a method of sound protection for a day in and day out job.

I bought a pair of Sennheiser HD280 Pro Headphones last year. They're studio monitor headphones used for mixing. They 're not NRR rated, but Sennheiser claims they offer 25 dB of sound isolation. I've used those to mow the lawn and they're pretty good. 

So, IMHO, ANC is OK for blocking occasional loud noises while you're out and about. But if you need daily sound isolation, get proper ear protection. Otherwise you'll be sorry as you get older.",plazman30,5.0

Alas, they arrived today and everything seems legit. In anticipation for it being fake, I've watched all of the real vs fake videos online. By all accounts, it adds up to being the real deal. Here are all the factors that I considered:  
  
1. They sound good. They have an identical sound profile as the pair I bought for my wife for her bday directly from an authorized dealer.  
2. I was able to register the serial number on the website. The serial number on the box matches the case (but the ear pieces have different serial numbers). These are all the same for my wife's pair.  
3. The packaging matches exactly that of my wife's pair. The fonts are the same, same material for the security pull tab, same plastic wrapper on the case, same hard cardboard cradle, same eartips packaging, etc. Everything is the same.  
4. Spatial audio works and I was able to scan my head.  
5. The noise cancellation and transparency modes are identical to my wife's pair (evidently these are dead giveaways, as fakes are not good).  
6. The find my AirPod function and beep function work (another giveaway of fake if these functions don't work).

Folks have brought their items to Apple and have confirmed these are high quality fakes. I'd suggest trying to get official confirmation prior to the refund window expiring, even then there's a risk as you'll read of the merchant not honoring or ghosting you over the refund. At best, you get lucky with a legitimate pair from their liquidated inventory from whoknowswhere. At medium, you'll have to play the warranty game to keep getting refurbs if yours don't work or update or get Apple support...but this warranty/game will last 1 year per their terms on the website (no, you won't be able to get AppleCare on these unless you're very lucky with the Apple Genius who will authorize it?).

All I can say is, diminishing returns hit pretty hard after a certain point. But just going by the pro 2’s to something like the hd800s is huge. Resolution takes a very solid uplift, so does imaging and instrument separation. Pro 2’s imaging is actually pretty great for what they are. It’s going to come down to what you crave in a high end headphone, but at the end of the day, the difference isn’t as massive as reviewers and audiophiles claim. Pro 2’s just so happen to sound natural, have great resolution for TWS, and performance for the price.

For reference I own 150+ IEMs and I have been in this for 10+ years. I've also been an Apple customer for a 15+ years until a few years ago when I stopped using their products since I do not seem to fall into their target demographics anymore.

This may surprise you but most non-dedicated companies generally apply the Minimum Viable Product approach and never invest more than it's needed as a base into anything. Especially Apple which is known to never put in more effort or money than it's required in any of their products, especially since Cook took over.

That being said, I never said the APP2 are bad, they are just good, they are nothing special, they are made to appeal to the largest audience possible and cost as little as possible while generating as much profit as possible. They're ok, not great.

I recently moved to the city and the car noise when walking to work was unbearable compared to the small town vibe I'm used to hearing. ANC doesn't eliminate the car noise entirely (that would be sorcery), but it makes it so so so much quieter and bearable.

These are the best tuned and detailed IEMs I own. I'm shocked. I've owned a handful of IEMs and headphones, but these take the cake in terms of sound quality and certainly in terms of features. I haven't reached mid-fi hell or and certainly not summit-fi, but these airpods break the boundary, to me, of the usual trade-off that wireless IEMs have against the products marketed toward audiophiles. These are my mid-fi tier. Previously, the trade-off was sound quality in favour of convenience, but for the gen 2 ApP this trade off is nowhere near as big or as apparent. I've used these every day since I got them for music/podcasts/audiobooks on my walk to and from work and for video and voice calls at home.

Wan'er much more exciting to listen to. AirPod Pro 2 jack of all master of none, not really that exciting to listen to.

For me the Wan'er's just feel more exciting. The mids are comparable, Wan'er has a bit more bass, but where the Wan'er really shines is the highs. Oh my god the highs on the Wan'er are amazing. Think songs like Nier OST or IU, where highs truly shine. I listened to IU's My Sea on both the AirPod Pro 2 and Wan'er and with the APP2 I got so bored of the sound signature 15 seconds into the song. With the Wan'er I felt a buzz of excitement the moment the song started and I ended up listening to the whole song enjoying it thoroughly.

I also listened to Brown Eyed Women off of Grateful Dead's Cornell 77. In the Wan'er the song was so lively and bright. On the APP2 it felt dead and boring.

If I had to describe it - Wan'er felt like the violin strings of the highs are vibrating, while the APP2 merely just outputs those highs like they were another sound. Songs on the Wan'er really pop and shine, whereas songs on the APP2 just felt you were listening on a regular car stereo but cleaner, that's it.

Also I did mess around with the ""EQ"" on the APP2. I set Vocals to Slight boost, and it felt like it was still muddy. Vocals to Moderate made it completely unlistenable. Bright on Slight was unlistenable. Wan'er would sit squarely between Vocals Slight<->Moderate BUT the Wan'er manages to achieve this cleanly and naturally sounding.

Song Update: Listened to Nier OST - Grandma (Destruction) fully on the Wan'er. Then immediately went back on the APP2 with the same song and immediately I noticed a veil covering every sound in the song. Like something was missing in all bass/mids/highs. It never felt more apparent as when you listen to a song fully on the Wan'er then switch onto the APP2.

*Disclaimer because someone's gonna make this comment. Obviously they are in different price brackets. Obviously the convenience of APP2 vastly outtrump that of the Wan'er, but that's an unfair comparison regardless and not the scope of this comparison. I just made this for anyone who happens to google this comparison and then comes onto this thread and finds it helpful!*

*Also if you're curious yes the ANC on the APP2 is amazing, so is the transparency mode. But I also feel like the passive isolation of the Wan'er is also really great.*",Ok_Minimum6419,20.0

I really wish Apple would give the user more granular control over EQ, but the best they manage is some alternate preset tunings and a slider to make things sound more high contrast buried under accessibility settings.

If you haven't done so already, on your iPhone go to Settings > Accessibility > Audio & Visual > Headphone Accommodations, and turn that toggle on. There are three preset tunings to choose from and a slider that makes things sound more crisp and contrasty.

The balanced tuning keeps the stock tuning mostly the same though perhaps boosts the bass and the upper mids slightly and clears out some of the veil. The vocal tuning tries to put more emphasis on the upper mids to emphasize vocals as the naming implies, though imo it makes music sound kind of weird and hollow most of the time (YMMV). The brightness tuning from what I can tell keeps the bass and mids mostly the same and seems to be a boost isolated to the lower/mid treble to give more of a perception of detail, though it may introduce some sibilance.

I feel like the balanced tuning with the boost slider on ""slight"" or ""moderate"", or the brightness tuning with the slider on ""slight"" make the APP2 sound a decent bit more open and exciting relative to the stock tuning, though feel free to play around with it. I find putting the slider on the strong setting in any tuning mode makes things sound a little too crispy and artificially boosted.

Now there is of course a intentional difference to wired lossless, its compression after all, and while that should be indescernible to almost everyone at the 256kbps bitrate apple uses, if you have very golden ears perhaps you can hear the difference. I wouldn't consider that difference ""laughable"" though.

I personally have not tried the performer 5's but I felt the pro 2's compare very favorably to iems in its price bracket and that they sound quite good relative to the s12/blessing/ie200/etc. IMO out of those few only the s12's really came close.

Of course, it's all preference, and perhaps you have absolutely golden ears, but to say the drivers aren't even close is a bit much, they are a very capable pair even for the price. That and I highly recommend setting up a proper ABX test between lossy AAC256 and a flac (or even mp3 320 and a flac) and seeing if you can tell the difference.

Keep in mind this is specifically for the pro 2's, the first generation pros have awful tuning and the ""regular"" AirPods suffer from their open-type design. I'm not saying they're the greatest earbuds to ever grace the earth, far from it, the tuning is quite boring apart from that signature sub-bass boost and a large part of their appeal is the DSP tricks apple plays (branded as spatial audio), but they sound good enough for me to permanently replace my iems for daily use whereas my previous TWS pairs were limited to the gym and not much else.

(I've also momentarily tried the AirPods with their vision pro headset, which is capable of lossless audio and while the latency was nonexistent the sound between lossy and lossless was identical. YMMV though. For hardcore listening I'll still grab my open backs or nicer iems. Those IEMS are still running over Bluetooth, over aac, to my quedelix dongle ;)",hi_im_bored13,4.0

That's a huge difference. 

Earbuds aren't meant just for music. They often accommodate other tasks that limit their full potential for sound. 

That's why many compare expensive Earbuds sound to sub 200 or even sub 100 Budget IEMs. That's how much better IEMs are in terms of sound than earbuds.

The Andromeda is the cheapest IEM you'll find that gives you an out of head sound field. To get comfortable and wear all day with an out of your head soundstage, you need to go CIEM, with the Supermoon ($1500 USD) or the Bonneville ($1900 USD). That is the true wear forever, feel like they are floating in your ears and never get uncomfortable because they perfectly for your ear canals! But they also attenuate sound by *a lot!* 

The Andromeda with Symbio or Comply tips is also pretty good for wearing a long time. Its all about the tips you use!

I don't know why you think its a big deal to have this ""transparency mode,"" really I think the best thing about IEMs is *not* hearing the crap going on around you. Why does it matter to hear when someone is coming up behind you? What's going to happen, and really, if something were to happen, what would you do that hearing that person would change the situation? For having a conversion, you just *take one out of your ear and put it back in after!* Especially if you get one of the above, even in Universal, which makes them $400 cheaper, then there is a *massive* gulf between them and the Buds2 Pro, for sure! The Supermoon or Bonneville is quite a far ways above the Andromeda, even in Universal, let along CIEM!

The difference in sound quality is in the single digit percentages, and most of the enjoyability comes from sound signature preferences. My favorite IEMs are the Sennheiser IE 900, 64 Audio Nio, Sony IER-Z1R, Empire Ears Legend Evo, and Empire Ears Odin. The Andromeda doesn't do it for me, because I just simply don't care for the sound signature. It doesn't hit the sub bass level that I prefer. Again, that's all subjective. They are great IEMs in their own right. The Galaxy Buds2 Pro are tuned just about perfectly for my sound signature preferences. It's unreal how good they are, when you consider they are $115, are small and comfortable, are an all-in-one DAC/amp/IEM/microphone/pass-through/ANC/case/charger combo, and are so insanely convenient to use. I have a FiiO Q5S, which is a more than capable DAC/amp. It's just too bulky to bring around. I also have a KHADAS Tea, which gets much more use, because it's so much more convenient. Still, I almost never use my IEMs. I'm telling you that there is no massive gulf between any IEM and the Galaxy Buds2 Pro. It's so small that it's not worth the extra cost and inconvenience. I'm a massive speaker/headphone person, and I just don't see the need for IEMs outside of performances or motorcycle riding anymore. Not having cables tied to anything is also a massive benefit. It feels so free to be able to move around without worrying about them being pulled out of your ears or getting tangled.

I'll try to explain the benefits of having transparency mode and ANC one more time. If you still don't understand, I'm not sure I can help you.

Transparency Mode: When sitting in an office setting with bosses, team members, and underlings around, blocking outside audio is unacceptable. It looks bad to management when they call your name and you can't hear. It looks bad having IEMs and cables coming out of your ears. Early in my career, I was told not to wear headphones in the office at all, and they thought I was just goofing around because of it. If I'm not listening to conversations going on in my office, I may miss critical issues I could be solving. When at the office, I don't have to remove anything from my ears. I just pause the music and listen. I can carry a full conversation without having to remove my Buds. If I'm not listening to the door, I could miss deliveries, office visits, people I could help, or my owner coming around the corner to see me on Reddit at work. If I'm blocking outside sounds while walking home from the train station at night, I could be completely oblivious to the crackhead walking up quickly behind me to jump me. I've avoided many dangerous situations just by being aware of my surroundings, and hearing is the first notification of danger. 

ANC: If I'm in a safe space and there is background noise I don't want to hear, having the ability to turn on ANC is incredible. Flipping from transparency mode to listen to the pilot, to ANC once we take off, is amazing. The entire world just seems to turn off. None of my IEMs provide anywhere close to the level of isolation as ANC buds. Of course CIEMs will do that, but I'm not even sure they would be as good at eliminating the constant low frequency hum of equipment or planes.

And again, they are $115. You can't even get a DAC/amp for that much, let alone IEMs that would make an appreciable difference.",Dasbeerboots,3.0

Never saw it that way before... I also never have been in that kind of situation before. Thanks for taking the time to explain, I always appreciated other perspectives! I'm not sure that a CIEM would eliminate the very low frequency him from say, a plane engine... They may, because of the excellent blocking once you have music in they might just drown it out. I've noticed that on planes, but having dedicated ANC would be better...

I had no idea that the Buds Pro are that amazing... Google must be taking a loss somewhere to put them out at that price, or they rely on sheer volume of sales to make up cost in development and research it takes to make a high sound quality product like that... I never heard anyone else say they are that great, but if they are a very good match for the DAC/amp inside of them... they could of course be quite good as the hardware would have some synergy. Just hard for me to believe that they are actually that great!

I might need to pick up a pair, and try them out! I bet they are in Amazon, so that's a low risk way to try them. If they are that good, I'd have to add them to my collection, since the transparency mode does sound very useful... I can totally see that now!

If they did this:
Made sure all forms of Volume Normalisation is turned off, didn't select Dolby Atmos songs for Apple Music mistakenly, and then did this blindfolded, they'd come to a realization that may eother make them just go back to emjojing music over determining what's better when frankly streaming is worse for the artiste revenue wise regardless of how ""better"" one service pays compared to another... Seems we've forgotten that paid music is cheaper now

And finally if they stop comparing Free Spotify and used a pair Spotify account and set the quality to Very High with Auto Adjust Quality slider off.

They're gonna be audibly indistinguishable from each other. Only time you'd hear difference is if the master file from which both are encoded are different and that's a rarity.

I find many Atmos tracks sound more realistic as they tends to put the drums further back with guitars and bass up front which is exactly what you will hear listening to a live band but some people might not like it at first as the drums sound is quite a bit softer.

I really can’t help you understand something when you’re determined to not understand it.

The revenue from streaming is simply not sufficient for most artists to survive, even one with 59 songs on Apple Music and over a billion streams (across all of the streaming platforms). Obviously, you do not want that to be true, because you get to enjoy streaming without having to pay a reasonable rate for what you consume. I get it. You’re not the bad guy here.

There are lots of reasons why basically no money goes to the artists. For starters, streaming services pay low rates, a small fraction of a penny for each completed stream. That money is mostly paid to labels, who then take their own significant cut before distributing anything to artists. The labels often gave sweetheart deals to the streaming services, because they were investors in those same services (“self-dealing”). For each song, there’s a points schedule, including the songwriters, the performers, the producers, etc. So out of a dollar of streaming revenue for a given song, those artists may see a penny, if they’re lucky.

An artist like Taylor Swift has her own contract with the streaming companies, and gets paid a much higher rate per stream, which further reduces the portion of revenue that the streaming companies pay out to other artists.

Maybe they don't care about him, but his music is similar to someone they like, and the algorithm keeps putting some of his songs into their playlists/mixes, generating more income for him.

There are dozens of artists I don't even know the name of... that keep up coming up in my custom mixes for me on Tidal.. I play them in the background, think ""huh, that's fine.."" but never bother to look them up.. and most of them I also don't sub to, because I like other stuff better.

But they will continue to be played on my streamer, garnering revenue for those artists.. Only a couple dollars per month. But if a thousand people do it like me, that's a couple thousand dollars per month..   


I, and the vast majority of other people streaming music, listen to hundreds of artists that we would NEVER pay money to buy a physical CD.. doesn't mean we don't like those artists..  
We just don't like them enough to spend hard-earned cash to buy their music.. back in the day, we would just record from the radio on our tape decks, or download the song from Youtube or fish them from the rough caribbean seas.. but we would NEVER spend money on their music.. we couldn't afford to, because we had other bands we preferred..   
Hell, chances are, we would NEVER even have heard of your buddy.. because he's not a big shot being played on radio worldwide.. 

Now, with streaming, we listen to people like him.. we generate income for these people.. they are suddenly all over the planet.. billions can listen to their music.. Chances for a couple hundred people to fall in love with their music are exorbitantly higher than without streaming, youtube, etc. 

&#x200B;

So, your buddy decided to ""whore out"" to the streaming services.. he made 100 grand and feels like he was cheated out of millions.. because he's somehow too stupid to realise that nobody would've fucking ever heard of him had he NOT gone to those streaming services in the first place.

You are wrong in the sense that audio is subjective and people won't automatically like something just because it's wired and ""audiophile"" nor does that necessarily mean it's objectively better. There are plenty of audiophile grade headphones that have a very disliked tuning that many/most people don't like (example: Beyerdynamic DT990, Grados)

The Airpod Pro 2 tuning is honestly much more fun and engaging out of the box that just about any audiophile headphone I've owned or tried. Do they have as much detail? No. Do they sound as open? No. Do they have as good of imaging? Not really. Are they fun and pleasant to listen to. Absolutely yes.

Even though I found the bass on the APP2 a bit too ""boomy"" and slightly bloated for my tastes they are easily one of the best *tuned* headphones out of the box that I've tried. I EQ all my headphones but if I had to take one pair totally stock for daily use it might be the APP2. They're just fun and engaging to listen to.

Also...

>a trillion features and gimmicks

Breaking it down:

* sound: prob one of the best TWS I have owned. It’s better than most of the sub-$150 IEMs I own. Details are not as good, but the sound is fun and engaging.

* ease of use: instant connectivity with iPhones, almost no dropouts, don’t need to deal with cables. Small form for both earbuds and case. Built in find my capabilities which works very well (I misplace my earbuds or case a lot). MagSafe makes it an ease to charge (using MagSafe charger). 

* battery life: I go days without having to charge anything. Connect to fast charger and both buds and case charge up fast if needed. Otherwise MagSafe charger is great and easy. 

* comfort: probably one of the most comfortable earbud I’ve ever worn. Lightweight, fits in ear easily and no extra weight from cable.

* build quality: I’ve dropped my earbuds and case on numerous occasions and they still look good. The sweat protection is also great (something my old TWS and none of my IEMs had).",alterndog,6.0

But that’s VASTLY missing the point of what AirPods are for. 

I would explain how massively useful they are and I say this with great confidence, I cannot live without a pair of AirPods. Not because they sound amazing (even though the sound quality is pretty darn decent, better than any consumer grade headphones I’ve tried or any other TWS IEM I’ve tried) but because of the “gimmicks”. If they are gimmicks to you, then why are you even considering them? If you don’t care about wireless or noise cancellation or anything like that, then why honestly even waste your time? 

Also to answer your question, IE200’s seem hit or miss. IE300’s have shit tier build quality, IE600s I cannot attest to since I’ve never owned them, but IE900s are decent. For $200, there are definitely better options than IE200. Just my opinion btw.

Back to AirPods, I have no idea who “he” is in this context, but even for audiophiles, convenience matters. Fruit for thought, but I think if you’re ultimately uninterested in TWS, then you won’t find one that you like solely based on sound quality, because you won’t find one that comes close to anything like a kiwi ears quartet for instance.

Convenience factor however is insane. The ""it just works"" factor cannot be overstated enough. This is the one part of the APP2 that should be romanticized imo.

Personally as a matter of taste - I don't like the suffocating nature of pure filtered silence, even in silence I like to hear birds chirping and that there's a world around me. With APP2's \*too good\* noise cancelling I felt like I was totally alone and it weirds me the fuck out.

[I tried measuring them](https://precog.squig.link/?share=Apple_Airpods_Pro_Gen_2), but take the squigs with a grain of salt because of the DSP that Apple applies when they’re in the ear. For example, sometimes I’ve noticed that the sub-bass quantity on my OG tapers off after a few seconds of having them inserted. [They also compensate depending on the loudness you're listening at.](https://precog.squig.link/?share=Apple_Airpods_Pro_Gen_2_70dB,Apple_Airpods_Pro_Gen_2_80dB,Apple_Airpods_Pro_Gen_2_90dB) Basically, both are very difficult to measure accurately. But down to the differences I hear in actual listening:

* The bass on the Gen 2 is noticeably more sub-bass focused than the OG, and with *significantly* more SPL than measurements might suggest. It’s not great intangibly - it still lacks texture and there’s a good amount of bass blurriness. But it’s pretty fun anyways and can certainly go brrr where the OG can't.
* Midrange on the Gen 2 is more forward from 1-3kHz. Perceptively, this gives vocals more bite compared to the OG. I wouldn’t say it’s quite in shouty territory; maybe on the cusp of being strident on certain tracks in tandem with the more exaggerated treble.
* Gen 2 has more mid-treble at around 8kHz, as well as slightly more upper-treble. This adds some upper-harmonics back to female vocals which the OG lacked. Again, these differences beget a greater sense of clarity to the Gen 2 but it’s not quite as smooth a listen.
* Treble on the Gen 2 still sounds dipped somewhere after 8kHz, in the mid-treble. I think this characteristic is partially what gives both the Gen 2 and OG uncharacteristically plasticky timbre for DDs. I wouldn’t be surprised if it affects the sense of bass texture as well.

Basically what you have here is a more exciting, technical version of the OG Airpods. It sounds less tame - more *dynamic* \- and the execution is pretty solid for the most part. But it's also not completely inoffensive anymore. I’ll keep them just because the new features and ANC are pretty good, and my OG Airpods are on their way out lol. It basically sounds the same on all three modes if anyone was wondering btw. Maybe like 1-2dB less 1-3kHz with transparency vs. ANC on. But that might just be psychoacoustic (eg. ANC blocks out ambient noise which, in turn, makes the upper-midrange sound more forward).",Precogvision,262.0

I work in a noisey lab (fans, vibrating equipment, etc) where we're allowed to have headphones in all day, but they can't be super isolating due to safety procedures and people coming up and asking you questions, so the transparency mode coupled with ANC seems like the perfect combination. 

But I'm holding off buying these because I DESPISE the fact that these are considered ""disposable"" tech by Apple themselves and have a lifespan of something like 3-4 years before you're literally just supposed to throw them away.

Hey Precog, really appreciate your insight and data on these. Could you help me understand something? I’m wondering, why is there such a noticeable difference between your measurements and Crinacle’s, I mean aside from DSP? I’m using the IEF Neutral target. Both of the graphs are normalized for 1khz at 60db by default. However, I notice for your graph, I have to go to the top area and re-enter 1000hz. And then that’s when the AirPods measurement will raise and line up with 60db at 1khz, same for the 1st AirPods Pro (a bug?). And so all below 1k is a big hill going up towards bass. It appears excessively bassy or muddy.

I double checked with Crinacle’s graph and went to the top to re-type 1000hz in the normalization settings. It is already lined up as expected. I realize digital signal processing is throwing a big variable into all of this but none of your measurements are similar to Crinacle’s. It just seems on your graph these are noticeably more V shaped, bassy, and bleeds into the mids. Then on Crinacle’s measurements they appear much more tame, balanced with less treble.

I figured this is just a confusing time that will clear up once this is all figured out but what doesn’t make sense is that I see the same general differences for your original AirPods Pro vs Crinacle’s measurement. Then looked further into this and I notice the same thing vs RTINGS measurements (1st AirPods Pro). One step further, I notice SuperReview’s graphing tool lines up more with your measurements (1st AirPods Pro). With his tool you have to change normalization from 500hz to 1000hz. Is this all just the difference in measurement rigs? If so, why wouldn’t it apply to measurements from Sony’s XM4 earbuds or XBA-N3, for example? Those are much more similar across the board. Thank you so much for any clarification. Here are the other graphs:
