Reviewers that make videos / write blogs for the general audience are probably going to weigh other factors more heavily than sound quality (e.g. ANC, battery life, bulkiness/form factor, software support, ecosystem & branding) while audio specific reviewers care more about the sound.

It's probably also worth mentioning that reviewers that cater to general audiences rate the sound of the gear subjectively and are less likely to look at the frequency response or other technical specifications, while (I think/hope) that audio specific reviewers use more objective methods.

These reviewers may also prefer overly bassy or V-shaped sounds (not that these are inherently bad), similar to what the general audience prefers. This is in contrast with audio-specific reviewers in in the hobby and *their* audiences who prefer a more balanced / transparent sound.

Just some guesses as to why there's a discrepancy.

To sum it up nicely, different types of reviewers and the audiences that follow them have different needs. Audio-specific people want to listen to things ""as the artist/sound engineer intended"" (or try to, anyway...), while the general audience just wants to have a good time on the bus/train/airplane.",ComplicatedMouse,47.0

That being said, a good TWS with strong active Noise Cancelling will probably allow better fidelity than a passive isolation IEM (where you still get all the vibrations from the outer ear). That's why TWS Active Noise Cancelling earphones are arguably unbeatable when it comes to fidelity (I say arguably because it's artificial, but still, you're cancelling up to 30dBs of noise with more accuracy than any passive barrier which is impossible to beat). Another thing to consider is that TWS earphones can be tuned to your hearing loss specs and to your ear canal with sonic resonance.  
Samsung Galaxy Buds a no-brainer option that's quite good and work seamlessly with Samsung phones that many already have.  
They're probably not as good raw, but Samsung has put a lot of R&D into making software tuning that achieves top notch results. I prefer brands that are not soft-locking features to galaxy phones, so I'd go with the Soundcore's A40s (noting that they had a faulty batch and you might have to ask for a warranty replacement, the customer support is quite good in my experience). The A40s have more flexibility in the software, allow dual device pairing, have really nice pre-made EQs, with the option for a flat curve.",zareliman,1.0

The MTW3 has [more mid-bass as well as more recessed upper mids](https://imgur.com/a/BF34yuF); the more recessed upper mids further accentuates the mid-bass bloat. 

I have both of these, to me the Buds2 Pro definitely sounds much cleaner and clearer out of the box while the MTW3 is a bit boomy and dark sounding, much less clear. It's not terrible though at all, and I could even take the bass as is if the upper mids were just a bit more forward, although my preference is just a little less.

I EQ the mid-bass down (-2dB) and the upper mids up (+5dB) on the TWS3, the new 5 band EQ actually has the bands right in the place you'd want them to correct this and after EQ the TWS3 sound great, I think possibly even better than the Buds2 Pro. Part of this might be the codec, the Buds2 Pro I'm using AAC on an Android (which is reputedly bad- Samsung phones have SSC which is a better codec) while the TWS3 is using AptX Adaptive (which sounds good to me on anything else I have).

Before EQ though, in their default out-of-the-box the Buds2 Pro are much better tuned. They are also very compact, have great intuitive touch controls that work and allow me to control everything (volume, stop/start, prev/next, ANC on/off, ambient on/off), ambient with a windshield so it still works even if you're moving, decent ANC.

Many more ""audiophile"" reviewers prefer a more restrained bass with sub-bass emphasis but with it coming down in the mid-bass so it doesn't bloat over the lower mids.

Harman's research also uses this sort of bass curve, where the bass emphasis is all in the sub-bass and with little mid-bass so it keeps a very ""clean"" sound.

Samsung owns Harman- hence why Samsung stuff is now also mostly tuned to the Harman curve. The Buds2 Pro are extremely close to the Harman curve.

Most headphone-specific reviewers are not fully on board with every detail of Harman IE, and I'm not either, but think it's in the right general direction. The Buds2 Pro in any case err slightly towards improving on Harman, most measurements they have slightly more mid-bass, slightly less upper mids and better treble extension than Harman, all of which are positives.

Some headphone-specific reviewers do feel the mid-bass cut on Harman is a bit *too* much, and prefer more of a glide down. Particularly for genres like rock music. And I can see that too, but the TWS3 are still just a little too much in the bass, stock. And there has been a bit of move away from this with other audiophile reviewers as well, Crinacle used be 100% Harman bass but his new ""diffuse field with a tilt  and a bass shelf"" curve, and newer collabs, after the bass shelf comes down it tends to slope down gently to 1kHz, while Harman goes in the other direction, it cuts very deeply and then slopes back up. And I think that is a bit much, and the *slightly* more mid-bass with the tilt down to 1kHz does sound more natural, if not quite as clean. But these are all splitting hairs in how much, they are mostly still much less than the the mid-bass of many consumer headphones.

But loads of bass has been the consumer staple for ever, I am old enough to remember Sony ""MEGA BASS"" in the late 80s, early 90s. I was total bass bass bass myself until relatively recently, it's only in the last 5 years or so when I started really getting into more ""audiophile"" Head-Fi I came to appreciate a more balanced sound. It's still there with some higher-end stuff, like look at the bass on the Beyerdynamic Xelento which is their TOTL IEM, it's nuts (although balanced by very present upper mids and then some spicy treble- it's not all bad). There is still a tendency even in the bassier audiophile stuff, like the Sony IER-Z1R, to prioritize sub-bass over mid-bass and to bring it down relatively quick to maintain ""clean"". And this is the thing, the Z1R is often considered one of the absolute end-game ""basshead"" TOTL IEMs. But it doesn't actually have *that much bass*,  it's only a lot of bass for something ""audiophile"". The MTW3 actually has more bass than the Z1R does- so this is where it comes down with ""consumer"" vs ""audiophile"".

It's what you're used to, as well. If you are used to tons of mid-bass bloat, that being gone will sound clinical, dry, tinny, lean, all of this. It's only when you sit down and use something with that signature, you'll get used to it and then go back to something bassy and it will sound just way too much. Listen to anything long enough and you'll adjust.",blorg,5.0

I don't know about other people, but there was a very quantifiable difference with mine. I was consistently getting *painful* sibilance issues *for months* and now it's just *gone* and I have been testing with control songs and many different tips. When did you do that first measurement and on what firmware? And what did you use to measure it? 

There are actually a lot more variables here because there is software in the buds themselves controlling the sound at least somewhat because of the ANC features and the fact that if you turn off ANC they lose a ton bass and when ANC is on if I move my jaw side to side there is this weird feedback noise for a split second on some songs, like a tone shift in the upper mid/treble region. I does not do that with ANC/Ambient off and it might have been fixed in an update because I don't remember it being that bad before. This is isn't like with normal iems or headphones and a gold plated cable or something, as soon as you involve software there is potential for bugs and edge cases.

I think the first measurement was around a year ago, I got them a couple of months after release.

I know what you mean by ANC seeming to increase bass. The interesting thing, that isn't seen in measurements. I think it's the removal of the level of incoming noise that increases the perception of bass. It's a real thing, I perceive it that way too. But not in the measurements.

I wonder if it wasn't a change in the tuning but in the ANC, and you use them with ANC.

ANC doing something if you move your jaw, it's probably transmitting a noise to the microphones which ANC then reverses, that doesn't sound odd to me. Some regular IEMs have bad driver flex if I move my jaw, it crinkles the driver due to the pressure. So I don't necessarily find this disqualifying, better if it doesn't but I can live with it. I don't like eating with IEMs in anyway.

Measuring with ANC on is tricky though, as it's going to add whatever is in the environment, my measurements are all with it off.",blorg,3.0

Everyone (or at least, most people) likes bass, and the recessed mids make it non-fatiguing, for longer listening. If you go straight from something that is recessed in the upper mids to something with Harman (or even IEF neutral- a bit less) upper mids, it can sound very shouty, thin, harsh, AM radio sort of sound. But you can get used to it and I think if you do, you may appreciate more what's in those frequencies. But if you prefer a warm, laid back, dark, non-fatiguing sound... nothing wrong with that, it's a preference.

It's strange that Sennheiser has long been doing these recessed mids on their IEMs when their best known headphones (HD600, HD650, HD800S) are very forward in that region. But I guess that's because that side of it has been led from the ""consumer"" signature. They are moving away from it now with the likes of the IE600 and IE200, which both bring forward the upper mids to more ""audiophile"" levels while also reducing the mid-bass, they still have tons of subbass but those two, the mid-bass comes down.

And more and more even random Chi-Fi TWS now are going more Harman with the bass, even some that are a bit wonky otherwise, it does seem to be getting more popular to cut the mid-bass and boost the sub-bass. Some of these it's probably a bit ""too much"", but there does seem to be more of a move towards trying to keep the bass out of the lower mids, in the last year or two, and more stuff is coming out that's closer to Harman.

I am a programmer and I was thinking along the lines ""did they try to fix that and create a bug or something?"" Because in the upper register and it's really pronounced compared to in the new updates. 

>I wonder if it wasn't a change in the tuning but in the ANC, and you use them with ANC.

Yeah that is what I am thinking now, I literally always have the ANC on. And they would seem to fluctuate a bit in quality but it's really hard to attribute that to the buds themselves or my current mental state or w/e.  I also don't remember having issues when I first got them in march, they might not have been updated though so that isn't something that can be used as a data point. I did just clean some gunk out of the little microphone hole, it was deep in there, though I don't know if that is relevant. But subjectively, I have them in right now I am fully enjoying listening to them and I did not a week ago to a level where I can't attribute it to a placebo effect. And if I put on the D.A.N.C.E. song it's not literally ear piercing for me. Though I am pretty sure I have a lower tolerance for that stuff that most people from my anecdotal experiences. 

The downgraded cleared the serial numbers to 0 and I think because of that they no longer update in the app which means I need to track down the newer firmware and upgrade manually. Which I am going to do at some point but it's Christmas here.

I was researching this a couple of days actually. I was on the fence between getting some ear pods to replace my Powerbeats 3. I ultimately had to pick between the Galaxy Buds, Airpods Pro, or the Powerbeats Pro. I even looked at the Echo Buds. All are great buds, but I didn't want to pay more than $200.

I ultimately settled on the Galaxy Buds because of the price, and I've been tracking on them since earlier this year.

I will say this, the sound is very good. I'm not sure how much different it is than the other buds, but for the money you will not be dissapointed.

One quirk though, these buds  don't have noise-cancelling technology. That said, it doesn't need them. I can barely hear the ""outside world"" when I have these on. Even when the volumn turned down/off I have to take my earbuds out if I really want to hear a conversation.

Also, my ears sometimes get tired of the buds if I have it in my ear more than a hour or so. Especially when I'm just sitting around. But, I think my ears have issues with buds with without the external support hook. That said, I simply take them out for a few minutes to rest my ears and I'm fine.

Here's my take on each, not that you probably care.  Your mileage may vary depending on ears/phone/lunar cycle/whatever.  I used the GB on a Note 8 and APP on an iPhone 11 (not pro).

* GBs do indeed have good sound reproduction for the form factor and price, but I wouldn't say the sound is noticeably better than the APP (though sound-per-dollar they're incredible compared to the APP).

* The GB last for 6 hours on a charge, and that extra 1.5 hours over the APP can be pretty noticeable.  However, the charging case can't go nearly as long as the APP case can (13 hours of total listening vs 24).  How important that is depends on your use case.  I never found I needed more than 1 charge before I had to pop the GB on the charger anyway, and if I had a Samsung phone with 'power share' I could just set the case on the phone to charge it wirelessly (I did not, however).  I don't like to constantly charge things, so it's been nice to go a day or two between charges for the APP, but I didn't mind the routine with the GB that much.

* Call quality on the GB is miserable.  People you're talking to sound fine, but you sound very quiet and unclear on the other end.  APP are leagues ahead here.  Most of the time folks think I'm talking on my phone and not a pair of earbuds.  I think this has been the biggest win for the APP in my book, moreso even than ANC.  Stellar call quality.

* GB don't have ANC like the APP, but the amount of noise they block out passively is pretty impressive.  As far as noise cancellation goes, it's almost as good as what the APP do *actively*.  If you disable ANC on the APP they let in far more noise than the GB.  That said, the ANC on the APP is pretty nice.  It doesn't do a great job at filtering out certain noises, but low, droning sounds like fans, engines, exhaust systems, etc. are almost entirely eliminated by them.  When you put them in it feels like you've gone deaf.  ANC does create a little pressure in the ear, which some folks might find unpleasant.  It was really noticeable to me at first, but I've gotten used to it now.

* If you use the GB in their version of 'transparency mode' the audio piped in sounds like you're standing in a giant aluminum can, whereas APP sound much more natural (though you can still just barely tell the sound is being reproduced).

* If you watch movies with wireless earbuds the GB have noticeably more latency than the APP.  How much that bothers anyone varies - and the GB weren't particularly *bad* in this regard - but the APP had almost no discernible latency to me whereas I could definitely tell on the GB.

* This is absolutely personal preference, but I much prefer squeezing the stem of the APP to tapping the touch pad on the GB.  I found that I would accidentally pause/unpause what I was listening to with the GB when I took a bud out of an ear.  I also like that removing an APP from an ear pauses my media, where the GB don't have an auto-pause feature.  Not a big deal, since you can just tap that touch pad to pause, but you can't accidentally unpause your media with the APP. 

* Also personal preference, but I like the fins on the GB.  I don't suffer any ear fatigue from them, and they add some peace of mind as to how securely they fit my ear.  I've never had the APP slip out, to be fair, but I also feel inclined to check them in my ear a little more often than is probably necessary.

* The APP worked fine on non-Apple devices, and the GB worked fine on non-Samsung devices.  I think the APP have better integration with Apple devices than the GB have integration with Samsung devices, but that's a very minor thing.

TL;DR: Lots of minor differences between them.  The big win for GB is how good they are for the price when compared to the APP.  The extra money from the APP could be worth it, though, if you want ANC, better call quality, and a distortion-free transparency mode.",fnixdown,37.0

I can use them on the treadmill, while I'm lifting, out walking, etc., and the charging case is small enough to fit in my pocket when they're not in use.

It's one more thing you have to charge (and the batteries will eventually die), the audio quality suffers because the DAC in the earbuds is typically crap, and with these new earbuds that are separate pieces it seems they would be very easy to lose. Imagine you're walking down a busy street, one of them pops out accidentally, lands in the road and immediately gets run over.

Most phones have nixed a headphone jack now, so you're honestly better off getting a decent USB DAC / headphone amp and a pair of in-ear monitors. For example:

[Fiio K1 24-bit 96Khz USB DAC / Amplifier](https://www.amazon.com/K1-Portable-Headphone-Amplifier-DAC/dp/B0189EVGAG/) - $40
Works great, doesn't really drain your battery any more than you would listening to music normally. It's also tiny, light, and has a clip to attach to your clothing. Note that you'll need a USB-C OTG cable, which is another $5 or so.

[KZ ZS10 Pro In-ear Monitors - $48.99](https://www.amazon.com/KZ-ZS10-Linsoul-Earphones-Detachable/dp/B07QKYTGH9/)
I have these, and they sound quite simply amazing. In-ear monitors of this quality were once very expensive, but now we can get them directly from China without a big brand name attached. They have a nice long cord that is replaceable, and they are very comfortable.

This is far less than the cost of the high end wireless earbuds...we're still under $100 total, and if you've never experienced 24/96 audio you don't know what you're missing. Tidal will stream at that quality level, but you probably only want to do that on Wifi. Alternatively, you can take FLAC files around with you on your phone, which is what I do. The whole setup is easy, lightweight, and cheaper than wireless while giving you amazing sound quality that you can *never* get with any wireless headphones.",CrystalSplice,3.0

They have all the same features at these at half the cost.  I use them daily listening to books and music.  They work great for phone calls and are not dependent on each other.  They are not noise cancelling, but even with nothing playing, outside sounds are barely audible.  This is great for cutting the grass and listening to anything!  The fit VERY comfortably and stay snug.  I have use them running a few 5k's and haven't had an issue.  The only things they lack compared to the Samsung is magnetic shared charging (although they do wireless charge) and the ambient noise option.  The app allows you to control the EQ and the other functions.

Get something like the earstudio es100 and it'll power huge studio headphones or high quality entymotic in ear monitors. Wires aren't annoying because nothings connected to your phone, just thread through your shirt if worried.

Passive in ear blocking with good foam tips is up to 44db on wide spectrum, far better than any bose/beats canceling etc.

The AptX Bluetooth codec is so good now that unless you're in a small proportion of sound engineers, the sound quality will be identical.

If you like sound isolated, in-ears will beat the best active noise cancellation over-ears hands down. Personally, I think the superior isolation of in-ears makes for a better overall sound than the range of on-ears, but it is really personal preference.

Cons for me are that the mic is useless, so don't expect to make calls if you're not in a small and quiet room.  Also the connection is *super* unstable if you're outside doing stuff.  If I put my phone my left front or back pocket and go outside, the Galaxy Buds crackle and randomly disconnect all the time.  I use them around the house, on the train, and stuff like that, but I have to put up with the connection issues walking to work from there, and even in large indoor spaces.

Perhaps, at this point, it’s impossible to be objective about branding.

To be honest I find the quality difference to be marginal. Maybe I'm a nontaster when it comes to sound but there's just no way I would also bring a DAC with me on top when traveling. It's not like I don't hear the difference between say the original earpods and my RevoNext, but as long as the sound quality is not so bad that it becomes distracting, it's always outweighed by the hassle of dealing with tangled wires. 

On the other hand I finally got a pair of ANC headphone for air travel and the benefit is so dramatic I would gladly pay a few hundred dollars extra for that feature and will never go without one when flying from now on. Charging is really not that big a hassle since I'm already conditioned to charge my phone regularly. Plugging two or three things instead of one thing in every night doesn't make much of a difference.

I do share your concern with non-replaceable battery though. That's the main reason I still haven't bought a pair of these wireless earbuds. The fact that they can't be disassembled without destroying the casing should be illegal. Imagine hearing aids companies doing the same thing. Serviceability of electronics need to be made into laws, I doubt the companies will do so voluntarily.",None,2.0

In-ear-monitors would like to have a word!

After trying a dozen different pairs of over the ear headphones, I broke down and bought a $500 pair of Shure IEMs (almost a decade ago). They sound amazing whether it's vinyl through a tube amp, a high quality DAC on my computer, or plugged into my phone / laptop / Switch. I don't have to worry about whether they're charged, or whether the bluetooth will be flaky. They're also really amazing at isolating background noise since they go inside your ears like earplugs - no need for fancy active noise canceling. They're a lifesaver when flying, blocking out even the loudest of screaming children. Oh, and since they're in ear, I can blast my music as loud as I want and it's completely inaudible to others - even if someone's laying in bed right next to me in a quiet room.",paracelsus23,1.0

I still have to experiment with that. I'm getting varying results myself, at least with hearing the receiving end. 
Mostly the call is great. Sometimes, if the person is on speaker, I can barely hear them. One time the audio was pretty ""crunchy"" and I had to redial to clear things up.

When I do talk it does seem like my voice is a wall-of-noise. I'm not sure if its the buds or whatever ambient sound settings I'm on. Others say they can hear me fine.

Apple battle, this is the feature where AirPods pull away from other brands. The call quality for the person opposite the AirPods user is top-notch with the outside noise reduction. I work in consulting, so tons of conference calls, and the not-so-occasional discussion with colleagues in an airport where there is tons of background noise. It’s incredibly painful trying to listen closely to someone using Bose or Samsung headphones, whereas AirPod users are so much clearer to understand. I have the Bose QC35’s (for the plane/relaxed listening) and AirPods (for everything else) and when I pick up a call from my wife on the QC35’s, she has picked up on it and will say, “you’re on the big headphones and I can’t hear you; call me back on your AirPods.”

The price point is certainly a deal breaker for most, so I’ll admit the comparison isn’t as simple as it would be if the Samsung’s were $180+. Their product is a screaming deal at $110. That said, Jabra, Samsung, and Bose need to step their game up in terms of call quality/outside noise reduction, especially at the premium price points (and hopefully at lower ones, too).

Maybe as time goes by, and small battery life becomes plentiful, that an ear bud can simply by as big (or as small) as a typical wired earbud. That way you get the best of both worlds in a smaller package.

Each earbud acts as a separate entity. That is, each bud will turn on and be functional when inside the ear. Once a bud is out, its deactivated from touch, but can still play (if it was previously activated). 

So, if one is low in power or lost, you can still use the one that works. Also, there's a Find Earbud feature in the Samsung Wear app.

If inactive, turning it on is as simple as putting it into the ear. You'll hear a little sound indicating that its ready to go.

Functionally, the buds only control play, pause, next (two taps), and previous (three taps). They also has custom settings for hold tap. Default I think its Bixby, but you can change it from the Samsung Wear app. I changed it for volumn control (left hold = volumn up, right hold = volumn down).

My left ear sometimes has trouble with them while my right ear is fine. I may just need to adjust the sharkfin ear fitter to a smaller size.

Also, for me, earbuds tend to wear out my ears after sometime anyway. I've tried various other buds in the past, some recommend as being totally comfortable, and I always have to take them out after a while.

Just noticed in this case that my left ear gets a bit tired. Millage may vary I guess.

These are pretty good for the price when compared to the $200+ ear buds. So, year I would recommend them if you are on that type of budget. 

Unfortunately, its hard to really try these things out at stores. I can't imagine that a store will let you ""test"" one out for multiple hours. I would say that as long as you have a receipt, then you'll be fine either way (since you can return them).

I wouldn't recommend them for kids though. And not just these, but buds in general. They are tiny, and even I have to be careful not to misplace them.

You either have bad ears, or don’t know what you’re talking about. 

It largely depends on codec obviously, but nearly *all* 128kbps encodes have a *hard* cutoff at 15khz. 

Are you telling me you can’t hear above 15kz? Because if so, that would explain why you think they sound similar. 

256 CBR generally extent up to 18khz, which is closer to being extended out of audible hearing range. Big difference. 

Also, lower bitrate will generally mean (since it was converted from a higher quality source) more inter-sample peaks. That causes distortion. Distortion is pretty audible, and at a bitrate that low, it can easily cause 3-5db peaks that will sound like noise clipping. 

Don’t try to pass off *half* the bit rate as the same, or indistinguishable from 256kbps.",T-Nan,6.0

I've worked in the technology industry for over 30 years, from 3-person startups to household names, and anecdotally, I've seen zero evidence of this. Compared to its overall unit market share, iOS has been significantly overrepresented in the firms at which I've worked over the last 10 years.

As an aside, I've observed that the same seems to be true of macOS—to some degree since the PowerBook G4 came out in 2001, and even more so since the Intel-based MacBook Pro in 2006. Worldwide, macOS' unit market share hovers around 10%, but walk around a major consumer technology firm in the US and you'd think it was more like 50%.

EDIT: Note that while I use exclusively Apple ecosystem stuff in my personal life, at work I choose (yes, it's my choice) to use Windows. I find it less convenient and more frustrating than macOS, but I don't want to lose fluency with that major platform, and I like the context switch (macOS = personal, Windows = work).

That said, CU fails on so many levels.

For white goods (generic term for appliances) I would suggest staying away from LG or Samsung because they don't have a service presence in the US. Buy a Whirlpool brand (Whirlpool, Maytag, JennAir, Kitchenaid, Amana) since they still have service companies in the US.

I would also consider buying from a not Big Box place. One that actually has a service department.

I would also look for a middle range price. Don't buy the top of the line because there are more electronics to fail, and the bottom of the price range is likely devoid of features that are actually useful. 

The other annoying game that they all play (manufacturers and retailers) is that the retailers demand a different feature set on their products relative to the competitor's product range. So there might be a $800 Whirlpool washer, but it's not the ""same"" washer as what the other retailer down the street sells for $810. Which makes comparison shopping difficult.",Sands43,2.0

&#x200B;

 Here's a list of ‌AirPods‌ features you lose out on when using the ‌AirPods‌ with Android:  


* [**Siri**](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/). On iPhone, you can tap to access ‌Siri‌ for doing things like changing songs, adjusting volume, or just asking simple questions. If you have ‌AirPods‌ 2, you can also use ""Hey ‌Siri‌"" to activate ‌Siri‌.
* **Customizing Double Tap**. In the Settings app on an iOS device, you can change what the double tap gesture does. Options include accessing ‌Siri‌, Play/Pause, Next Track, and Previous Track.
* **Automatic switching**. ‌AirPods‌ are linked to an [iCloud](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/icloud/) account for Apple users, which allows them to easily switch between using the ‌AirPods‌ with an ‌iPad‌, iPhone, ‌Apple Watch‌, and Mac.
* **Simple setup**. Pairing with an iOS device only requires opening the case near said device and following the quick setup steps.
* **Checking ‌AirPods‌ battery**. On the iPhone and ‌Apple Watch‌, you can ask ‌Siri‌ about the ‌AirPods‌ battery life or check it from the Today center on iPhone or the Control Center on ‌Apple Watch‌. Luckily, there is a way to replace this functionality on Android [with the AirBattery app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=friedrich.georg.airbattery&hl=en_US) or [Assistant Trigger](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dotarrow.assistantTrigger&hl=en_US).
* **Automatic ear detection**. On iPhone, when you remove an AirPod from your ear, it pauses whatever you're listening to until you put the AirPod back into your ear.
* **Single AirPod listening**. Listening to music with a single AirPod is limited to iOS devices because it uses ear detection functionality. On Android, you need to have both ‌AirPods‌ out of the case for them to connect.",TJNel,9.0

That's straight up facts you can deduct even without seeing the products.

Wireless is inherently worse sound quality wise than wired. I have no doubt they're both decent, or quite possibly even among the best, for wireless ear buds but they still will lose to the best sounding headphones even within their price range.

Therefore, if someone is looking for the best possible sound, they most definitely won't pick either. Both of those products are made for consumers who are willing to sacrifice a bit of sound quality for the numerous usability (and possibly style) gains those tiny wireless buds offer over massive and wired slightly better sounding options.

Open up ""spek"" or any spectrogram and there is plenty of information up there. Sibilance, high end from any hat, crash, or bright sound, etc. If there wasn't ""not much above 15khz"", codecs wouldn't extend up to 22khz. 

Unless you're exclusively listening to music from the 60s and earlier, everything extends past 15khz, easily.

And by that, you're agreeing with the point of the comment above you.

Xerox Alto was the first computer designed with a GUI and a mouse, in 1973.  Steve Jobs visited Xerox PARC in 1979, saw the Alto and ""borrowed"" and refined the concepts for the Lisa/Mac.

Apple innovated on other mp3 players as you suggested, they took an existing idea and refined it.

I had a few smartphones before the iPhone was released (Sony Ericsson P800 and P900, and an iPaq), and while a more modern smartphone is obviously more advanced, when the iPhone first came out, it didn't even support apps.  Apple was riding high on the popularity of the iMac and good marketing though.  

There were a few ok at best Android tablets prior to the iPad too, you could argue that the iPad was more mainstream and offered a better user experience, which is fair, but it's still not innovative to refine an existing product. 

I 100% agree that Apple is great at popularising technology, and refining UX, but to credit them with inventing new tech in the last 30-ish years is a bit laughable.

My point was, without Jobs and Apple, who knows what computers look like today. The Xerox Alto sold 2000 units in total. It was a novelty item, nobody actually bought or used them. 

The Lisa and later the Macintosh really revolutionized computing. They bought GUI and Mouse use to the mainstream. So sure, invented is the wrong word. But without them computers as we know it today likely don't exist.

People hate to acknowledge it but Apple is the reason we have personal computers today. Sure, it's possible Xerox or Microsoft would've found a way to eventually come around to what we know today. But that's not what history is, fact is Apple is the reason a LOT of our technology we use today exists. 

Without them, the modern personal PC doesn't exist, without them the modern smartphone doesn't exist, without them the modern tablet doesn't exist. 

> inventing new tech in the last 30-ish years is a bit laughable.

To be fair, I didn't credit them with inventing anything in the last 30 years. Mouse + GUI was longer than 30 years ago. The correct word though is innovation. 

They are probably the most influential tech company in the world, whether we like it or not. It's almost sad watching them slowly devolve into this mess of a company since Jobs death. I really wish Jobs had spent more time grooming a successor properly and managed to find a younger version of himself. Instead, we got Tim Cook and the rest is history. 

I also do agree that Woz did most of the actual inventing at Apple. But I do struggle with people who give him all the credit. 

Woz and Jobs had one of the worst and best relationships ever in tech really. Jobs would have a vision of something and Woz was able to take that vision and make it a product and Jobs was probably one of the best marketers in modern history and knew how to sell his vision. 

Needless to say, I can't stand the cult behavior behind Apple. I don't use really any of their products. But while he was a real asshole for most of his life, I'll never stop looking up to Jobs for what he did for modern technology. Sure, he wasn't the man making most of their products but he was without question a visionary in the space.",Uther-Lightbringer,0.0

I would argue they're not 'innovative' now. During Jobs tenure, they not only made certain fringe products popular (personal computer, mp3 player, smartphone, tablet etc) but they also turned them into VASTLY better products than what currently existed.

I would argue now, simply due to the ecosystem and fanbase. That they no longer innovate. But more so they can bring out an equally or inferior product these days and still popularize an entirely new space. Lets be frank, the Apple Watch isn't that great. There were much better watches before it, there are much better smart watches now and there will be better smart watches in the future as well. Same goes for Airpods. 

The glasses could maybe be impressive and revolutionary if they're actually available in various styles and functional. But I doubt they will be, we'll see though.

Are you looking for true wireless earbuds or studio headphones?  As far as studio headphones or true wireless earbuds go it depends on your budget. At the beginning of this year (prices and selections have improved since then) I bought all of them at the same time. I tried Apple AirPods, Bose sound sports, Jabra elites 65t, and the Sony 1000s. At the time they all fell into the sub $250 range. 

Having owned many of Bose headphones over the years, I was always happy with the overall quality of sound and build quality for the price. That changed when the last wired Bose earbuds I bought started to fall apart in less than a year. Their sound sports had above average sound quality, better than the apple and Sony, but the fact I had already been dealing with poor quality workmanship from Bose lowered my enthusiasm to spend $199 on them. 

Apple ear pods work like they are suppose to, easy to pair, and good battery life, but lack any real depth in sound, and didn’t stay in my ears well.

The Sony 1000s were just all around lack luster and really seemed to be selling a bunch of options that weren’t really needed or mattered. Especially for the price at the time which was around $220 if I recall. 

Ended up going with the Jabra elites 65t at the time they were $240 I think. The sound quality was rich with great bass and midrange, along with highs that were crisp and clear.  Came with multiple ear pieces to allow for good comfortable fitment, definitely the most comfortable and securely fitting out the group I tried. I would say Bose was close second in comfort, and sound.  The Jabra charging case and earbud battery life is great, phone calls work well, they have a pass through sound setting so you can have them on at work and still hear when someone speaks to you. It’s almost been a year since I’ve bought them and I’m totally happy still. 


As far as studio headphones go, I would highly recommend looking into Sennheiser. They have a very large line of headphones to match almost any budget . They are a company that has been around a long time and have always produced high quality audiophile level equipment.  Even their lower price sets will impress your with their sound quality. 

They also have a very nice set of true wireless earbuds, but they were out of my price range at the time I was choosing.",CarbonReflections,2.0

Right, and I didn't claim it did. That's really not the point. This is a thread about the GB having better sound quality than the others, and how someone said you should buy the one that fits your brand.

My point was you should buy the ones that fit your criteria. You don't just pick whatever because you can't have the best of all worlds. If sound quality is your second highest priority, you'd pick the GB. 

I wasn't going to get into the weeds about every possible feature because it doesn't really matter. You pick what fits what you want best. If you want sound quality and truly wireless, but don't care about the rest, GB are your go-to. If you want ANC more than you care about sound quality, then maybe you go with the airpods.

If you are listening to Apple Music or an AAC audio track on an iDevice or Mac through Airpods, then there is no drop in quality because Apple has designed the ecosystem in such a way that there is no need to re-encode the audio (assuming decent gain and a low SNR). On the other hand, if you change any of these parameters you will risk breaking the chain that makes this possible and will lower the quality of the audio.

The reason why people are so happy with bluetooth is that everything is kept secret from the user. You don't know how often the connection speed has to drop because of radio interferance, and you probably aren't noticing the occasional drops in audio quality that result from them. Even the underlying codecs are kept extremely vague; They are marked as supporting AptX, which is a brand name covering multiple codecs, or as supporting MP4, which is just a container that can handle an even greater number of audio codecs.

I agree that once paired, both types automatically connect to your Bluetooth (given it's turned on), but I guess it's those two small scenerios (first time pairing and automatically turning on) that give it a convenience edge.

It sure is, just like MacBook Air when it comes to exceptional design. But I wouldn’t say it’s defined laptops, nor did Apple invent the laptop.

The Samsung watch was popular first and finally a year later after Samsung’s first watch came out Apple Watch. Again, I think you and I are speaking to different things. Microsoft failed with the zune because Apple had invented the ideal media device. Apple hasn’t maneuvered in the same skill set as when they made the zune obsolete. If the technological success of Apple was the same now as it is today, we wouldn’t see any other laptops, watches, pens, external hard drives, headphones, etc. What we don’t see? Zunes, skip-free CD players, etc.

A whole bunch of word salad about the history of personal media devices. Feel free to address the Apple Watch's dominance in the smart watch market in 2019. Or just keep talking about the Zune and shit. Whatever.

Sony is fine, but honestly I lost my first two galaxy buds and then have managed to hold onto the sonys but the battery is getting worse, the one pair of LinkBuds have a garbage mic (the open ones). The other pair sounds really nice but not significantly better than the only buds+ I had with way better battery and a nicer, less heavy fit IMO.

I've never owned the pro 2's yet but I'd say they are 100% worth it just based on the research I've done. To me, it seems like the best options are as follows:

**Soundcore liberty** for budget sound. Most earbuds in its price range have bad mics or other issues.

**Galaxy buds/Air pods/OnePlus** depending on your phone. Sony ones if you're willing to take the risk of having battery problems. Same as above. Most headphones in this range have glaring issues in some form but these 3 brands have no abysmally bad features.

**Gemini II/Audio Technica AZ80(?)** if you have money and want a premium pair of earbuds.

Honest to God though, I've never found a pair of earbuds that hit like the galaxy buds in battery life, mic quality, build quality, and overall consistent performance for its price.

If the Buds2 Pro are sitting at full price and you've got alternatives like the WF-1000XM4 and OnePlus Buds Pro 2 at a lower price point, it's definitely worth considering those.

These are the ones I've actually owned, minus the WF-1000XM3 (which I omitted, as I don't think you can find it anymore at regular retail), and I can provide honest feedback.  
  
In terms of ANC performance, Sony takes the cake, followed by Galaxy Buds and then OnePlus Buds. Sony's ANC is pretty much the gold standard here, Galaxy Buds2 Pro are actually pretty good, and I can say this from personal experience, since I work in a seriously noisy place. OnePlus Buds might not be your best bet, mostly because their passive noise isolation is borderline awful, letting more noise in.

  
Onto the sound quality breakdown:  
  
WF-1000XM4: These provide the warmest and most laid-back listening experience for my ear out of this bunch. The bass is powerful and deep, yet well-controlled. The mids have a decent presence, but there's a noticeable dip in the range of 2k Hz to about 8k, making it sound slightly more recessed compared to others on this list. The same goes for the treble, with a strong dip around 12k Hz, resulting in the sound being more muffled than the rest. That being said, it is a great option if you're sensitive to trebles and a solid choice overall.  
  
Galaxy Buds2 Pro: If you ever happen to listen to these side by side with Sony's, the comparison may be quite jarring. Unlike Sony's, these aren't afraid to let that treble shine through. They offer a confident, in-your-face type of sound. In terms of quantity, there's slightly less bass (really not that much) compared to Sony's, but quality-wise, they are on par. Both have a rich presence and impact. The midrange is slightly more pronounced here, but the most significant difference lies in the treble. If you happen to be sensitive to treble, these may come off as shouty and sibilant. Personally, I love my treble, and that's why I prefer these over the XM4's. Another thing to think about is the high bitrate Samsung Seamless Codec, which I believe is supported on Galaxy devices starting from One UI 4.0.  
  
OnePlus Buds Pro 2: In terms of audio, these fall somewhere in between Sony's and Galaxy's. There's a lot of bass here, even more so than the other two. While it delivers a nice impact, it doesn't feel as deep as its competitors. On default settings, the mids are on par with Sony's, and the treble, while not as defined as Galaxy's, also lacks the strong dip seen in Sony's. That being said, they are by no means worse, and this sound profile might be right up your alley. It's also worth noting that the customization options on these surpass both Sony's and Galaxy's. In addition to a personalized ""golden sound"" equalizer, you have access to a regular 6-band one and various presets.

When it comes to software, especially since you've got the S21 FE, the Buds2 Pro might score a little extra. The controls and overall experience just feel smooth and polished. Sony's app is pretty solid too, offering some decent customization and reliability. Now, OnePlus and their HeyMelody app, well, it's the weakest link here. It's got this kind of ""chinese"" software vibe, and overall, it's not as stable as the other two.

MY comparison between Sony's WF XM4 & Buds Pro 2:

Sound: Buds Pro 2 sounds better. Now, don't get me wrong, Sony has always been up front in Audio Engineering. They're one of the best, if not the best. But Samsung's Codec really makes a difference! Use them with Apple Music Lossless & you can totally hear the difference (I use a Samsung Galaxy S23U).

ANC: Sony wins. No contest. Samsung's Pro 2 has a decent ANC, but against Sony's? They have no chance of winning.

Price: I got my Buds Pro for $149. My Sony's cost me $170 at the time, but should be cheaper by now.

Fit: Buds Pro 2. All the way. Sony's made my ears hurt after a while of using them, Buds fit perfectly. I will add, though; Buds Pro 2 don't feel as secure when working out as the Sony's did.

Buds 2 Pro and buds 2 have wireless charging, fe doesn't.

Buds 2 pro has way better fit than buds 2 (in my personal opinion), buds fe has the best fit with the wing tip. 

Buds 2 pro has superb bass but the rest of the audio quality is probably the same since they all get the same updates, there's slight difference cause of the drivers in each.

Build quality buds 2 Pro is night and day better than buds 2, buds fe is cute but doesn't feel that premium compared to buds 2 pro.

Don't focus on sound cause there's various way to maneuver around it to your liking. Focus on features, price and build quality.

First problem is that they don't fit my ears. The tips connecting part is too short, and any tips you use with it will be closer to the base of the earbuds than your typical earbuds. The base had a large round hump which is incompatible with my ears because it seeks to push outwards from my ears whenever my face makes a light movement. The stock tips are especially short and unusable with the earbuds for me because it brought the large round hump closer to my ears. So every time I smile or talk, the earbuds would become loose and lose proper seal. Tips too long, and the earbuds won't fit inside of the charging case. Because of the large round humps, I had great difficulty trying to fit them in my ears in the first place. >90% of the times I wear them with the stock tips, I would get a failed seal test. With my own tips, they fit in my ears a lot better, but becomes more difficult to fit inside of the charging case. I primarily use ""ML size"", which is not included with the stock tips, since they only provided what I would describe as ""XS, M and XL size tips"". That's a total of only three sets of tips. All of which are too short for me including the ""XL sized"" one. Because tips too long, and it would have trouble fitting inside of the case.

Another problem I encountered was that the sound was very fatiguing out of the box which means I would have had to use custom EQ with them. The Samsung app doesn't seem to provide a custom EQ function. I also just didn't like the sound signature in general and I don't know if any EQing would fix that completely. I didn't bother going through the trouble of custom EQing with a 3rd party app because they didn't fit my ears anyways. But I did try the EQ presets provided with the Samsung app, and I did not like any of them. There was one that was at least listenable for me which was the ""soft"" mode due to it being the least fatiguing. But most people in this sub seem to like that one the least.

Third problem I countered was that it makes a piercing mic sound every time I try to put them on which I find very annoying.

I also later discovered that they don't have multipoint function. My 80 dollar headphones have that function.

Based on the negative experience I've encountered, I would probably want to stay away from Samsung earbuds altogether. Even though I use a galaxy phone.",DreamIn240p,1.0

But I must say, I just got the buds 2 pros on a deal for $100 with phone purchase. I was skeptical, especially with how they'd fit in my ear, but I'm very impressed. Stuff like this is always on sale, so I would not pay full price but I would pay more than $100 for them. I'd maybe go to 180-200 maybe. The ANC is the best I've ever experienced. This is compared to Beats Studio 2's and Soundcore q35 headphones. Both have good ANC, but these buds 2 pro completely tune out coworker conversations in our open office space. That's worth it to me. The ambient mode is great while I'm cooking. I only wish they supported multipoint but I've never had headphones that support that so not the end of the world, but for the price I'd want to see that added before I spent over 200.  I haven't tried the Soundcore Liberty 3, it's what I was considering before this deal. The Liberty 3s support multi point. I have the Soundcore A1 life for running and they are a great fit and sound but on the cheaper end. The Liberty 3s are the more pro sound version of a bud so I trust they're only better. Typically only 80-100 on Amazon.

You push them in a tiny bit and the tips will make a seal and stay in because of the suction force. This is where I assume most everyone fucks up because they think they need to jam every earbud halfway down their ear canal. I'm not using stock tips but those stayed in fine but my spinfits don't budge. Like I sneeze and they don't budge. And if I push them in too far they collapse and break the seal which makes them fall out and all that shit. 

The thing about shallow fits is if you don't have the right size tips for your ear, which might be different than other earbuds, and/or you put them too deep and/or a bad angle and you won't make a seal they won't stay in. The key is the seal. You have to get the seal.  The seal.",TheTomato2,2.0

Where you getting a seal with the tips?  Because that is how they stay in. Not catching the top of the ear lol. Idk what size spinfits you have but try one step up in size than you normally might think, play with the angle a bit and push them in *slightly* until they seal and you get the *suction force*. You know you have it when you have to actually (with very little force) pull them out.  If you push them in too far they might collapse (at least for me becausemy ear canal tapers pretty hard) and they will lose the seal and which makes them loose.  And like I sneeze and mine don't budge.

Like, I have some Momentum True Wireless 3s and they go deeper in your ear and catch the inside of your outer ear to stay in and the seal is mostly just for sound. Even the plain buds 2 go a lot deeper. And yeah if you have too big eartips and they are deep in your ear canal you can have that issue you had but buds 2 pro sit *right at the entrance of your ear canal* so it shouldn't really be a problem. 

And just this next part not just for you but anyone else googling this shit because I know it can be incredibly frustrating and I have seen so many posts here about them falling out:

The buds 2 pro are 100% designed around the seal keeping them in because they are: 

1.) shallow

2.) very light

3.) small
 
To give you an idea, when I use the large cp360 tips, which are too big for my ear because they kind of slowly push themselves out, they still make a seal but they poke out a bit and because the angle of my ear canal body of the earbud *doesn't even really touch my ear* and they still won't budge like if I *vigorously* shake my head. And I just push them in lightly ( I have to angle the top of my buds more up because of my ear shape) and they stay.  If you aren't able to get a decent seal, and I think 99% of people can with some finicking and the right eartips (and the stock eartips aren't bad), these aren't worth using. They just won't sound good, they have won't have good ANC and they won't stay in. Get something that you can jam farther in your ear and/or with wingtips.

Also people like the comply foam tips because they will conform and make a seal almost automatically, but I would guess 90% of the time it's more user error that they are covering. Personally for me they muffle the sound a bit (I even cut out the stupid ear wax guard to try to mitigate it), and because they go deeper in my ear canal and because of the shape of my ear canal they create this horrible sibilance in the upper treble region because these buds have a spike around 8k region to compensate for the shallower fit. I've been read about people with sibilance issues with these and I wonder how many are just jamming them in too far. Like I have wonky ear canals that immediately bend to the back of my head and taper a lot (which is why I like spinfits over stock and the azla's ) and I alway shave sibilance issue with bad fits in any earbuds so if can fix it I *would think* most people can. But I am also not any ear-ologist and Samsung *may have* designed this for asian ears (I say that because its not as uncommon as you would think for japanese/korean companies) or something and there is nothing you can do, idk.  

And it should go without saying, clean your damn ears. Too much earwax and it doesn't matter what eartips you use, they will slide out because that is literally what earwax is designed to do.",TheTomato2,2.0

This must be a paid promotion because I have the complete opposite to say. I am 30 years old so I've seen the wireless buds market come up from nothing. I have bought every new pair a year for the past idk 7 years or so maybe more. For 200$ then what you got was crazy, wireless buds that sounded good. Battery life wasn't a thought nor water proof. Well every year I spent around 200 on decent earbuds so I have experience. I have come to know what is good and what isn't and with the buds 2 pro they are lacking. The one perk is the waterproofing. They are literally the same buds as the buds 2 that cost half the price. Only difference? The speak to chat that does NOT work reliably so I still have to take a bud out to talk because I can't wait to see if it decided to go to ambient mode this time. And another killer is the battery life, 4 hours on my week old buds 2 pro. I also have the Sony wx1000xm4 which cost 279 I think and man those are where it's at because the speak to chat works every single time and I legit can get 8 hours of playback. I kind of took them for granted and always wondered if the buds 2 pro were better or even the same and I can confidently say the sonys are by far the best.  And if your considering the buds pro 2, just get the buds 2 and save your money. And to the mic I legit have to disconnect and use speaker because no one can ever hear me(in parked car with my galaxy fold 4) ear tips are the worst I've seen but that's the same for buds 2.

Either to memory foam or something like spinfit cp1025. I dont know why samsung wont put in better tips or at least have couple of memory foam tips thrown in like Sony has done with XM4. 

I am curious about BT LE. Would that improve battery life as well. 

Biggest con of samsung products is their focus on marketing the bullshit. Whether is MP race for camera or 24-bit here which adds little value. Still its a solid product and best part is they thrown these in if you buy their phones. I almost got this and watch 5 for free with my purchase. You just cannot beat these buds at that price. I have not yet received mine(fedex is saying tuesday) but I am looking forward to comparing it to my Jabra Elite 75T.

Sound quality is hands down the best I've heard. The ambient mode is good when walking around places where you need more spatial awareness.

ANC is eh. It's fine, very effective in low frequency noise cancellation but I think airpods Pro had better ANC. It's not bad, most useful in cutting the engine noise when I'm traveling in a noisy bus or train. 

Oh and calls!  I've tested them in very noisy environments. People on the other end could hear me and no noise. Except when a huge plane was passing above me, mom said everything went silent for a few seconds.

A few years back I accidentally reused old earplugs (trying ironically to protect my hearing). When I woke up the next morning I got out of bed and fell on my face.

My left ear was pretty obviously infected. Internist makes quick appt, puts me on an antibiotic. I take the pills religiously, but it wasn't clearing up. I got busy at work and it took a few days to see doc again. 

This time he gave me the strong stuff, guaranteed to leave a type 1 diabetic like me with a yeast infection, so I got him to prescribe something for that to avoid third visit, promising to wait til I was done with the antibiotics.

Ear infection clears up. Hearing loss doesn't. I saw an audiologist and I had 30% hearing loss in left ear.

My (pretty good) insurance at the time had something like an $800 copay on hearing aids. I paid $1500 for a $2300 aid and lost it in a server room about six months later. With all the fans on I used to remove it when working in them. Client  ""didn't find it"" (assuming he even looked).

I have had a lifelong habit of always walking on the right of someone. Haven't been able to shake the habit in the 14 yrs since my hearing loss. I can't really hear someone clearly to the left of me.

If I were you I wouldn't use earbuds just because of the damage the music is probably doing to your ears, let alone a stray bit of earwax getting moldy and you don't notice or clean it sufficiently.

With the right sound settings enabled (Adapt Sound, Dolby Atmos, etc) and the right sound quality (like Hifi or Master tracks from Tidal) these have been better than any over-the-ear headphones I've owned.

After letting my ears recover. I started trying other tips, thinking that they were the issue, being the part inside my ear canal.  All were an issue eventually (some worked for a couple times, but then caused irritation) though Azla Crystal tips seemed to solve it.

I hadn't used the buds for several weeks and wore them for just an hour.  That night, the soreness and watery discharge occurred once more.  I was done with Samsung.  I was 3 weeks outside the Jan 31 extended Amazon return date.  Contacted Samsung.

The first chat resulted in a ticket #.  Then someone called me and gave me another ticket #, asking for an email of my receipt and a photo of my ear.  I said my ear showed nothing externally, so sent photos of the Q-tips I used!  They also sent me a HUGE box, with pre-paid labels to return the tiny buds to an individual in Plano TX.   

Someone else then called and asked for me to send the email.  i said I have!   She searched my ticket # and said she found it and apologized! 

Eventually, I got an email confirming, as a ""courtesy"", a refund, but only if I sent a picture of my ear.  It didn't matter that it showed nothing.   So, they got one! (I think Samsung are farming ear shapes for future bud design)  I was later to receive another email with an link to confirm how I want my refund paid.   Yet another number to access that link.  I'm still waiting after a week!

Samsung has the most cumbersome customer service process I've come across.  Other OEMs fix it on the first call/chat!!

I mentioned the irritation to my Doctor and my thoughts about the tips.  He said the ear is very sensitive and the ear canal can react to irritation outside the ear.  So, the buds body or charging contacts could be the problem.  The last irritation resulted in a crusty skin outside my ear, which never occurred before.  Taking longer to heal. 

I have many other ear buds and never had an issue before.  Now, I'm finding occasionally they also cause irritation.  My ears seem more sensitive and troublesome now.

I had exactly same issue as everyone else as everyone else, ear wax going bonkers, wet ear canal, crust on outside etc.

But I loved(still do) buds pro so much I thought it can't be materials or allergic reactions, I had used like 4 different buds and never had this reaction before. So I read up and boom, turns out I was being and idiot and jammed my buds pro way too hard into my ears for a better seal and better noise cancelation. So now I just put buds pro with that spin move without any force and didn't had a problem since, use them almost everyday and noise cancelation is still good and they haven't fell of of my ear once.

So yeah, not defending samsung, this had to be caught in testing and I actually don't know why would it be caused in a first place, maybe seal being so tight it almost creates a vaccum? Idk, do we have ear doctors here?😄",None,31.0

I hate this. 3.5mm IEMs or headphones will work the same regardless of what device you use. USB-C is the same, even more identical since they have their own DAC. But Bluetooth? Oh boy are you in for a shitty experience when you take one of these ecosystem earbuds to another platform. Samsung has its own proprietary codec, Apple uses an optimized AAC, which most other manufacturers use a shittier version. Sony has LDAC, it's in ASOP but still basically proprietary. You have Qualcomm with aptx versions, but Samsung stopped supporting it and apple never did. SBC sucks.

It's a fucking mess. And it's made even worse because Samsung won't even produce and sell you a BT dongle that supports their codec for PC or Mac. So you're stuck with shitty SBC or AAC.

Is it too much to ask for one scalable codec to become the standard? So I can use BT earbuds across different devices without them sounding like shit",Put_It_All_On_Blck,15.0

1. You always get treatment you need. No financial checks are done, ever, for any treatment you need.
1. The treatment you're talking about simply isn't available here. It's for an extremely rare disease, and it's experimental. If they refuse treatment in another country because you don't have 2 million, how is that the fault of the Dutch health care system?
2. Medical debt doesn't really exist here because all available treatments that you need are covered, and you maximum bill per year is 300-800€. Of course that coverage doesn't include new and experimental treatments **in other countries**. 
3. Belgian parents in the same situation did the same thing and raised money. This wasn't a purely Dutch situation.
4. You think your average American can ""simply go into debt"" and get 2 million USD? You can only go into debt for an amount you can actually pay back. If you can't pay the bill in the US, you simply die.

The Pixel Buds Pro are a great alternative, especially considering they're 40% off right now, comfortable fit, custom EQ, better volume controls, and a great companion app even if you don't have a Pixel phone.

That's not to downplay the value of the Buds FE, for their MSRP, they're great, but they were missing a couple small features that turned out to be deal breakers for me, like having to choose between Sound Modes and volume controls for a long press control. Plus, the bass can be really loose and woofy, which I experienced on some tracks that put me off a bit. Otherwise, they are great, and were super comfortable.

You can also undercut the value of the Buds FE and go for something like the Soundcore Space A40, which has really good reviews.

If you're deadset on Galaxy Buds, I'd say start out with the Buds2 Pro to see if the fit/comfort works for you, because if they do, they're 100% the better and more features packed earbud. They didn't work out for me, but my wife loves them. If you can, buy from a store with a good return policy. If they don't work out, give the Buds FE a try.",zjb29877,2.0

Since then, I have used the buds Live and often I would straight up forget that I have a bud in one of my ears, because they let sound through pretty well and are very comfortable.

  


Recently I decided to get the 2 Pros, and while I don't think I'll fawn over how seamlessly they fit in my ears, I have had no issues with comfort (I had had some issue with the original buds Pro, if that tells you anything), they isolate noise very well with ANC, and primarily I ofc got them for sound quality. Another plus over the FEs is wireless charging (which is actually not relevant for me), and water resistance (which is very relevant for me).

  


Voice detect - I can't really think of any reason I'd use that feature, lol.

The trick is foam ear tips. With the stock silicone tips, the sound is just too tinny and fatiguing and the ANC is just alright. But with foam ear tips, the lower end is much fuller and the tinny sounding highs are suppressed for a much more pleasing and comfortable sound. The ANC is also drastically improved due to the higher frequencies that they normally have a hard time with being cancelled by the foam.

The FE are just a more affoedable version, probably not even a better value as the Buds2 Pro can be had for barely over a hungie on Amazon right now. (Under if you opt for Amazon Renewed!)",xblackbeltninjax,1.0
