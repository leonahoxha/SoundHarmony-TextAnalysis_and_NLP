They are good, but noise cancelling is a joke! Even a 30€ headphone have better noise cancelling and they dont not 10x more but ok.
Sound is great, and they are ultra loud even for a wireless Headset! But when the noise cancelling was much better and the comfort is was a 9/10 Headset. 

Sadly the Dock have many Bugs too. Sometimes my Headset turn off just randomly and Sometimes wired Sound Bugs. But Overall its a good Headset both not for this Premium price. 

I have this Headset 1Year.  And buy first some wicked cushions ear pads  :/ i really miss the old good hyperx cloud alpha comfort but ok.

I have the razer barracuda pro as a second headphone.  I need to try this later. I buy them because noise cancelling is very rare for Gameing Headset",Darkcroos,2.0

The sound quality of these and the Pros have both felt like a downgrade even with tweaking the EQ and sound profile. Not only that, the hinges give me almost no confidence in how long they’ll last. But the biggest thing that made me immediately say no to these was the fact it started to cause inner ear pain, and no it’s not because the noise cancelling buds (they don’t touch any part of my ear at all). Or maybe it’s what they do that causes the pain, or the way it’s designed, I don’t know but using these caused some minor pains after a couple hours and next day caused inner canal pain and discomfort.

I also noticed that when left still, you can't even swivel them without your pads SMASHING into each other. It's like it was designed to crush a toddler's head in. And I doubt it will loosen any time soon with a metal support.

&#x200B;

And after 4 hours, I've resorted to just placing them on top of the flap of my ear just to keep them from causing pain.

My C2 Wireless started having issues where it would just slowly drop volume until it reset, and Scroll Wheel issues, and replaceable ear pads torn up, but so far it just seems like a better set due to how uncomfortable the Nova Pro Wireless is. Just cut out the padding on them and put them between the normal pad and the giant spears stabbing my ear, and it's slightly better so far. Obviously more muffled sound.

&#x200B;

Edit: Day 2. After messing with sizing, and location, I've managed to get a bit of it to reside with 5x the padding inside the cup than sent normally with the headset. Still hurts after about 1 hour, though.

The sound quality is very close. The Astros have more bass and the SteelSeries has better mids/Highs. For listening to footsteps the SteelSeries are slightly better because footsteps are a high frequency noise. However it isn't good enough to overlook it's other flaws.

The software of the Astro is much better and fine-tuned. The Steelseries software is buggy and wouldn't detect the headset half the time.

I had the ps5 one. They do have clear and accurate audio. Frequencies are pretty good 

But they lack punch to it and they are probably one of the most uncomfortable headphones because of the ski band top and the shallow ear cups

The main problem seems to be the Frequency Response Consistency category, where it is noted "" The SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro have disappointing frequency response consistency. They're very prone to inconsistencies in bass and treble delivery due to fit, positioning, and seal. You may especially notice a drop in bass if you have thick hair or wear glasses, as this can break the ear cup's seal. ""  Where as the A50s "" These headphones have great frequency response consistency. This means that they deliver audio relatively similarly across different users and between reseats. ""

So it looks like it was a fitment/head size issue maybe.

""Gaming"" headsets always mean you pay around 3 times the price for even worse quality, a lot of plastic and components that would count as budget level for any regular normal music/studio headset. Astros Amps are fine (and you would need one anyway) but I heavily recommend using one of such amps in combination with a quality non ""gaming"" headset. I did the same a few years ago and was blown away about the sound quality. You can combine regular headsets with a mic and get the same exact features you would get from regular gaming headsets, but with a sound that is unmatched. btw: that gaming basically means more expensive for the same thing could be seen in companies like Philips, who had gaming headsets that were actually the exact same models they sold without the tag, but for 3-4 times the price. Its pretty extreme what's happening in this segment but people usually have no comparison so they pay 300-400$ for ""premium"" gaming headsets without knowing, that the same Audi quality would cost them less then 80€, but also grants them high quality double straps and real cushions instead of the ultra cheap fake leather most have.",Seitenwerk,1.0

but like i said, if you spend over 300€ on a headset, you expect more than just fine soundquality. 

the base station shows two dots and suddenly my headset is empty. i use the cable to load my headset because the station is unreliable. whenever i put up the mic to mute myself, i have to put it down multiple times for it to unmute and there is no unmute button. the headset is being hold together by shitty screws that just pop out, so now that i lost 2 of these really small screws i tried to get it fixxed and they wanted me to ship this shit to england for a repair instead of giving me back my money, as if i am too stupid to put in two screws. for some reason my headset started slowly sliding down on this game/voice scala, ending up muting everyone in discord. really fucked with my head the first time that happened lol. you can hit your right earpiece to use it as a button, but i always end up using it on accident, but that one might just be my own stupidity. 

before i got this one i tried many others and they had even bigger issues from the moment i started using them, so i send them back. the wireless headset market seems to be pretty garbage, so i guess its not that bad of a headset. 300€ is just too much for something that is good when it works, but barely works.",kriegnes,1.0

The bass still has a bit excessive presence, which is expected & even ideal for gaming headphones. There's a really weird peak in the high mids that might be designed for footsteps or something, but it's hella annoying for music.

The worst part is that the band on the top is a huge downgrade and the headphones are so small that I can't tell if they tried to change from over-ear to on-ear since my ears don't fit in there, which reduces comfort. These things won't stop falling off my head.

For the wireless connectivity (if you're not using the wire), the connection is also a bit hit or miss and leads to a lot of fuzz.

People comment on these being less bassy than other gaming headphones because they are, but that doesn’t mean the. bass response is good. It’d be fine if it didn’t drown out others sounds as much.

I bought the wireless and tested it both wired and wireless, with and without noise cancellation.

This sounded less tinny out of the box for sure, but the sounds is still pretty bad all things considered. It really fits the gaming headphone lineup in that way. They have a huge boost that I thought was for footsteps, but it seemed to make gunfire obnoxiously loud.

They are good-ish as far as gaming headphones go, but that’s not saying much. They should be $150 cheaper and the issues with the band not being sturdy enough as well as the earcups being terribly awkward still remain.

I generally don’t recommend this headphone, but I’d bet that landing an HD6XX on Drop and getting an external microphone connected to it lands someone in a better spot at the same price-point. I’m sure there are also closed-back options around $200 that beat these as well.",BaileyPlaysGames,1.0

I've seen lots of others on here with a multitude of problems with their peripherals. Personally, have only had 2 problems. The design of the Arctis Nova Pro Wireless can be literally irritating due to the ANC mic that protrudes from the inside of the earcup. Usually only a problem for those with big ears (hand raised here). That can be solved with a purchase from Wicked Cushions. 

The other problem was a strange firmware glitch. For some reason one of the firmware updates to the headset did something to the HID programming in Windows 11 and caused the headset and dac to be unrecognizable. That was fixed by doing the old ""Uninstall all usb's in Device manager and restart."" My problems were easy to fix but who knows what will happen to you. I've had my headset for a little over a year and it has been performing well, other than what I mentioned. 

I personally think they are still worth the buy, especially due to their features. I also think they sound better than the ASTRO A50s.

Physically, it's great. I did have to buy bigger ear cups from wicked cushions because the ANC driver or whatever it is that sticks out of the headset is really painfully for my ear after an hour or two. 

I think something is going wrong with either my PC or the software, I don't know anymore. 

I played a lot of Overwatch and when 2 came out my headset just stopped working with it. I thought it was the game. For months I couldn't communicate through VOIP. 

Then the same thing started happening with Warzone. No one in my party could hear me unless I used discord. But some were on consoles. Eventually I figured out I have to mess with each games voice chat settings, go into windows audio settings and change things there as well. Every time. 

I also have to unplug and plug it back in every time I want to use it to chat when I first sit down to game. 

In windows setting I have to have it on Arctis Nova Pro Wireless instead of Steelseries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless or whatever it is. Sometimes GG won't recognize it and I have to mess with settings to get it to recognize the headset. Then end up having to settle for Arctis Nova Pro Wireless in the GG selection because Steelseries Arctis Nova Pro isn't an option and that makes me feel like I'm not getting any advantages from the software. 

I tried troubleshooting with support and when nothing worked they sent me a new headset and since I used their RMA process to get a headset in the meantime, I was charged $350 and would be refunded once I destroyed the old headset. 

When I received the new one no one would answer my emails for a month. So iahd that charge on my card the whole time. Eventually someone gave me the next steps to destroy my old one, which felt shitty. Then I got the refund. And the new one still has the same issues. 

When I asked for more troubleshooting no one responded. When I asked again after they sent an automated follow up email, no one responded. 

It's left a bad taste in my mouth and I'm disappointed. I'd either go either Arctis Pro Wirless I never had an issue with those. Or another brand entirely.",BludOfTheFold,4.0

What I was referring to was the number of issues I've noticed between both headsets in my limited experience with both.  The biggest issue with the Nova Pro Wireless is Sonar.  The entire software system around the Nova Pro Wireless is a giant pile of steaming garbage.  Let's ignore the useless ANC and regression of the base station as far as usability and build quality. 

Maybe you can make the argument that certain gaming situations the Nova Pro Wireless is better at giving you directional awareness and more intentional boost to footstep volume etc, but at the end of the day I'm wearing a headset for way more than just playing a game for an hour or two.  The Maxwells play better sounding music, thanks to the far better tuning and excellent planar drivers.  The Nova Pro Wireless is a muddy mess and lacks resolution overall.  It's not even a comparison.  The mic is a similar situation.  

The worst part is that the Arctis Nova Pro Wireless is a regression in so many ways from the last gen headset it replaced.  At least with the Maxwell I can listen to music with properly tuned drivers and take meetings with a decent sounding mic, all while being able to rely on welded joints instead of plastic ones. 

Neither headset is perfect, but you are crazy if you think that the build quality of the Maxwell is somehow inferior to the Arctis Nova Pro Wireless, and that the sound quality, all things considered, somehow tilts in favor of Steelseries, because it doesn't.",bigdbag999,1.0

Three pairs of the Arctis pro wireless and one Arctis Nova pro Wireless.
We use the Arctis pro for movies on UHD Blurays and streaming with Nvidia shield tv pro , also for couch co-op on PS5,  nintendo switch (with 4k gamer+) and Xbox series S.
All goes via spdif from the tv so that's how we get all those working, this way we get the DTS headphones X to work with everything coming out the TV.
They are amazing sounding if you make your own EQ settings for movies and games, and as we daisy chain two pairs (the other 3rd one is for our bedroom tv) you can make your own EQ without having to think about the others, this goes for volumes and general settings too.
It's an incredible that it even works.
They all have wicked cushions padZ for better isolation and sound, the og cushions are trash Imho.

The Arctis Nova pro Wireless I use exclusively for PS5 when I'm going in solo, the 3D tempest in these cans is ridiculously good,var least since Sony updated the 3d sonics with Dolby Atmos support, but I got to say, I upgraded the ear cushions recently and I've had a much better sound experience since. I bought the wicked cushions freeze Hybrid cushions and it's incredible what they did, the passive noise canceling alone is worth it but with the Active NC on it's a full blown dream come true.
I was just about to buy the Audeze Maxwell too but now, I'm staying put saving 400$ in the process.

So there for multi console use,
The Arctic pro Wireless is the answer.
For one or two console use, the Arctis Nova pro is your answer.
Both sound amazing but the edge goes to the Nova pro Wireless because it really has better mid response and deeper bottom response.

The best antenna is on the 2015 version, the 2017 version has a good range but connection drops on mine and the 2019 version has the worst antenna, shortest range but is the best overall machine.
We have 2 Artist Pro wireless connected to a Spdif splitter, both get  virtual surround DTS/Dolby 7.1 from the TV Spdif out into the slitter and then into an Avantree Orbit then out to the Arctis pro wireless headsets.

What I have noticed is that if you use an USB 3 disc for more space it screws the Bluetooth signal, so maybe use an extender and then try again. IBM did a full investigation on how usb 3 devices bugs out wifi and Bluetooth signals if too close

Typically you can check reviews for top products in a category and if enough places say one is the best or second best it's typically fairly accurate.

With gaming headsets I find the top ones are legit straight up dog shit.

Last year I bought 5 different ones via Amazon as they don't give AF about returns and I don't give AF about their costs for having to restock.

All of them were top rated and all of them sounded terrible for surround sound and mic quality.

I ended up getting the next model up of my Logitech ones which ended up being the G935.

To this day I've yet to find a better headset for surround sound simulation in shooters and other games.

It's pinpoint with a killer mic and amazing audio quality.

It's a bummer because I want to find something better as the battery seems to die after a year where it drains much quicker but nothing else seems to best it.

TLDR. - gaming headsets are stupid and all review sites are clearly paid and full of shit. Just get G935's by Logitech.",SpacedDuck,1.0

So I recently picked these up and agree with the side tone issues you point out and thanks for the heads up on the Bluetooth staying on even when it is turned off.  I have discovered one thing that helps with the sidetone issues which I believe to be rooted in the noise cancellation feature of the headset.  So yep, just turn off the noise cancellation by double clicking the power button and your sidetone will finally sound good.  

I originally bought these for my wife as I had the Arctis Pro Wireless headset and she always wanted one.  In the end, she liked the way my Arcis Pro Wireless fit better so now I am using the Nova Pro Wireless lol.   The battery life issues you are dealing with I haven't run into yet, and they seem to be lasting longer than my Arctis Pro wireless batteries were but then again I might not be using Bluetooth as much as you are. 

For those curious, I don't see a ton of difference between the Arctis Pro Wireless and the Nova Pro Wireless outside of a different feel(not really better or worse).  Though I will say you need to adjust the filters heavily to make the nova pro sound decent.  Oh and for those who have trouble with your Arctis Pro Wireless disconnecting because of wireless interference.  The Nova Pro Wireless handles it a little bit better by not disconnecting persay.  The audio just gets super robotic during times of high interference.",ShoreXShot,3.0

I'm sitting here listening to music, and for a gaming headset, they sound great.   Yeah, they're not going to top an audiophile headset, but I'm still willing to bet most of the sound complaints are coming from people who have no clue what they're looking at when they see a full eq band.  Also they have to realize you're also paying for a ton of features..... If they're only worried about audio, you go with audeze, in they price range.   If you want  an all arounder, you go with something like these.

I have the Nova 7, not the Nova Pro so can't compare everything completely, but one key difference is that the Nova 7 has the fabric pads. I do have a set of the leather pads on order directly from Steelseries, they should come in a couple of days. I'm hoping they provide a better feeling seal, and that they can keep my ears a bit cooler potentially. 

I do really want to love this headset though, because from the ones I've actually tried myself it's got the best set of features, and I do actually quite like the software. There aren't many that seem to tick every box I'm after otherwise.

The other headset I'm currently trying is the Razer Barracuda X 2022, and it's just okay. Doesn't sound great, does put more pressure on top of my head than the Steelseries one does, is cheaper, but has fewer features.

I'm almost at the point where I'm considering buying some good, aptX LL headphones and getting a separate desk mic.",SeerUD,2.0

But in general there making a wired headset that does compete with the other overpriced stuff from companies like astro/logitech/razer/etc.

They make a $100, that is the barebones product they make. Then they add some gimmicky bullshit like hi res certification and other stuff. That brings it to a sell price of $120, then they add a (what they charge) $130 usb soundcard. Which brings it to $250, this price also includes stuff like E sport sponsorships, software development, marketing, sale headroom, and more.

Then they make it wireless which they feel is worth charging an extra $100isd for.

At the end of the day for what your getting it's the same as other brands. It's just not all brands end up making this type of super feature inflated product. I think this type of product is stupid and not worth people's money.

But it's not crazy in terms of what the market sells stuff for. The gaming market in general pushed this inflated garbage. Look at any gaming brands top mouse and keyboard. There over priced garbage. Like corsair mechs which are super low quality but cost an arm and a leg.

The issue isn't steelseries top end gaming headsets. The issue is top end gaming products as a whole. There over inflated junk 90% of the time.

This is a sneak peek at the 2022 version of the guide. The 2022 version will include the auto message here, along with a version of this on my personal Sub, and a very in-depth version on my website. For now, this is a slight alteration of the 2021 auto message but with 2022 Q1 updated spreadsheet included. The goal for December is to update all the auto messages first, repost all the guideposts on my sub (this will happen anytime the guide changes as I can't change reddit post titles).

Once the Website guide is up please use that as I'm so limited on reddit that the reddit versions have to be so cut down. So your find the website guide so much more helpful. I couldn't even include notes here.

[OLD Reddit guide for more info on some of these (CLICK THIS LINK TO VIEW THE EDITED OLD GUIDE)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifelongCaboose/comments/kq00im/12a_lifelongcabooses_wireless_gaming/)

**Index (READ FIRST)**

1. **Wireless Gaming:** Not a Sound Style but a bonus guide. Sort of different than before but mostly the same. If you are not willing to sacrifice quality for wireless then turn away now. But if you for your own reason need wireless and are willing to sacrifice value and quality then this list will have the best of the worse options that may not be amazing but will still be decent. But know that your options will be limited and don't expect to be able to get amazing  ""Pure FPS"" performance or amazing tonal balance out of any of these.
2. **Alpha Value:** This is the Alpha Version of my grade ranking for headphones. This will change over time.
3. **Grades:** You will see every headphone/headset has two grades. The **1st Grade** being its **Tonal Grade**, this is the grade for how well its sound signature is tonally balanced. The **2nd Grade** is its **Tech Grade**, so all things outside of the frequency response, staging, imaging, separation, detail, dynamics, etc.
4. **PLEASE DO NOT COMPARE CLOSED-BACK RANKS WITH OPEN-BACK ONES AT THIS TIME!**
5. **Rankings are not everything:** Which is why Notes and Sound Signatures are important, but you must view the full guide to see those.
6. **Sound Signature VS Sound Style:** Sound Signature is the tuning of the frequency response. Sound Style is my term for the different categories I put headphones in for gaming.
7. **EQ/VSS:** If you need to use some light eq to help, go for it just be careful. Maybe even Virtual Surround Sound(VSS) if you can't position with stereo. I don't recommend VSS but some need it.
8. **External USB/XLR Mic:** If you plan to buy an XLR/USB mic for gaming please get a Dynamic mic, it will cancel out background noise better. (Don't buy a Yeti/quadcast/snowball)
9. **IMPORTANT:** Names with a bold **(X)** at the end of their name mean I don't recommend these that highly but may be good for the right person.
10. **IMPORTANT:** Wireless headsets have a lower lifespan and are not as easy to repair meaning once there dead they become E-Waste.
11. **Wired Use:** If they offer a passive out it will not only sound worse than the wireless connection but also worse than a true wired version.
12. **Latency:** Ideally you want below 60ms. Under 35ms is pretty much latency-free. Under 60ms is low latency. Under 110ms is ok for casual use. Over that is bad.
13. **EQ:** If you use a good parametric EQ not the crappy one included with most software suites, you can get good tonal balance out of these but it won't make the technical performance any better.

They are all disappointments.

Here is my list made before the Nova.

# Wireless Gaming Guide (Auto Message)

This is a sneak peek at the 2022 version of the guide. The 2022 version will include the auto message here, along with a version of this on my personal Sub, and a very in-depth version on my website. For now, this is a slight alteration of the 2021 auto message but with 2022 Q1 updated spreadsheet included. The goal for December is to update all the auto messages first, repost all the guideposts on my sub (this will happen anytime the guide changes as I can't change reddit post titles).

Once the Website guide is up please use that as I'm so limited on reddit that the reddit versions have to be so cut down. So your find the website guide so much more helpful. I couldn't even include notes here.

Full External Website Link (Coming Late 2021-Q1 2022)

[OLD Reddit guide for more info on some of these (CLICK THIS LINK TO VIEW THE EDITED OLD GUIDE)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifelongCaboose/comments/kq00im/12a_lifelongcabooses_wireless_gaming/)

**Index (READ FIRST)**

1. **Wireless Gaming:** Not a Sound Style but a bonus guide. Sort of different than before but mostly the same. If you are not willing to sacrifice quality for wireless then turn away now. But if you for your own reason need wireless and are willing to sacrifice value and quality then this list will have the best of the worse options that may not be amazing but will still be decent. But know that your options will be limited and don't expect to be able to get amazing  ""Pure FPS"" performance or amazing tonal balance out of any of these.
2. **Alpha Value:** This is the Alpha Version of my grade ranking for headphones. This will change over time.
3. **Grades:** You will see every headphone/headset has two grades. The **1st Grade** being its **Tonal Grade**, this is the grade for how well its sound signature is tonally balanced. The **2nd Grade** is its **Tech Grade**, so all things outside of the frequency response, staging, imaging, separation, detail, dynamics, etc.
4. **PLEASE DO NOT COMPARE CLOSED-BACK RANKS WITH OPEN-BACK ONES AT THIS TIME!**
5. **Rankings are not everything:** Which is why Notes and Sound Signatures are important, but you must view the full guide to see those.
6. **Sound Signature VS Sound Style:** Sound Signature is the tuning of the frequency response. Sound Style is my term for the different categories I put headphones in for gaming.
7. **EQ/VSS:** If you need to use some light eq to help, go for it just be careful. Maybe even Virtual Surround Sound(VSS) if you can't position with stereo. I don't recommend VSS but some need it.
8. **External USB/XLR Mic:** If you plan to buy an XLR/USB mic for gaming please get a Dynamic mic, it will cancel out background noise better. (Don't buy a Yeti/quadcast/snowball)
9. **IMPORTANT:** Names with a bold **(X)** at the end of their name mean I don't recommend these that highly but may be good for the right person.
10. **IMPORTANT:** Wireless headsets have a lower lifespan and are not as easy to repair meaning once there dead they become E-Waste.
11. **Wired Use:** If they offer a passive out it will not only sound worse than the wireless connection but also worse than a true wired version.
12. **Latency:** Ideally you want below 60ms. Under 35ms is pretty much latency-free. Under 60ms is low latency. Under 110ms is ok for casual use. Over that is bad.
13. **EQ:** If you use a good parametric EQ not the crappy one included with most software suites, you can get good tonal balance out of these but it won't make the technical performance any better.

That confirms basically what I thought to be true, that MH75X range is truly a stellar one since they are also based off the Takstar's, a studio-reference headphone on a budget. I've been blindly recommending these babies to anyone because it gets so much right, just sad to see that these expensive headsets don't really do anything of note.

IMO, I’ve thoroughly enjoyed the sound that I’ve gotten out of my XTs (I also have my DT 770s and 990s with a SoundBlaster X3 dac/amp). If they don’t work for you then that’s fine, but sound (specifically headphones) is hard to be objective since everyone will perceive it differently.

It's just how it sounds.

Sound guys graph shows its pretty uneven and far from neutral. Also remember sound guys uses a B&K rig and does no on head testing nor do they list how they get there measurement or if it's an average or an ideal fit. 

The ear gain are very placement dependant and on a normal head in a normal listening position it will sound closer to the H3 non pro hybrid graph.

Bass is still muddy and bleeds hard into the mids, but where the H3 at least has the right shape with elevated sub bass this doesnt and it rolls off.

Treble is fairly forward and over 10k sounds fairly dead and lacks air.

It's overall super limited by the fact that is the low end H3 driver and the Pro version did nothing to change that. So unless they release a new model with a new driver it's going to remain a v shaped, low resolution $70 headset with features to inflate the price sadly.

I also find the H3 comfort mediocre. H6 pro line is more comfortable and neither are as comfortable as the mh751 which also sounds better.

But only because ""Studio headphone"" is mostly marketing fluff. Most headphones marketed as a studio headphone often don't mean in terms of sound as most of them don't have a sound that matches any target or reference. Pro 82 which the mh751 is based on is definitely no reference. But it is a good headphone.

They got super luck picking a good oem headphone. I assume they say all the takstar pro 80 rebrand and decided to get in on it and picked the newer model. Which is good because the pro 80 is hella out of date now. Pro 82 rebrand are great. I know from talking to them they seemed super proud of it. Sadly attempt 2 with the mh600 line was a flop Imo. They rebranded another takstar but this time it wasnt so good. 

But mh751 Super good value.

Do note. Cooler master rebranded an existing headphone that was already a good value.

Steelseries are trying to build there's from the ground up. They have been trying to do this with a wireless headset since 2013. So there $100 headset gets a $100 dac and $50 in marketing fluff and software. Then they add $100 for wireless and anc, but remove the dac, and add a baystation. 

The cooler master mh751 is smart because it has no added bullshit to inflate its price. Just a good quality headset. Vs the Nova which is trying to offer everything.

Honestly alot of these gaming companies would be better off selling rebrand. But I love seeing companies try to innovate. An it's awesome to see how far Steelseries has come with the mud monster that was the H wireless. 

So in general, these headsets like the Nova are not expensive headsets. The headset is an entry level headset, it's all the stuff around it that makes it cost so much. And Imo that kills the value and makes it just overpriced junk. This is pretty much gaming headsets and consumer electronics in a nut shell. 

Buy an Mh751, fulla 3e, use peace and eq APO along with any free vss. Boom you spent less and have a better product. Because you bought each individual part from a company that does that thing well. Rather than 1 company trying to swiss army knife it.

But in terms of actually driver dynamics they lack punch and slam. They hit like a wet noodle. And no tuning change fixed that. The bass is just loose and dynamicly weak. Like some of the worse bass dynamics on any headphone. 

Mids are also super grainy and lacking any detail, this goes all the way into the treble which doesn't know what detail even is. It's a joke. 

The sound on this truly is maybe the worse sound you can get over $200. It's a shock how it got approved. 

Not all about a headphone is subjective. Tonally and tuning can be measured pretty well and you can determine alot of objectives from that. An in every measureable and listen able front the Virtuoso performs terribly.",LifelongCaboose,1.0

You should understand, you likely have a fairly normal head with normal sized ears. The sort of person who finds a DT770 or XM4 quite comfortable? But for many, headsets with smaller earpads can be literally unwearable. Those are the people you’ll find constantly posting here about comfort. Comfort >> sound for these people. I cannot stress this enough.

The biggest offender in this sub is something like the Penrose, which is an absolute joke - or possible even a torture device.

SG’s measurements are on top end B&K rig. Extrapolating against many of the other headphones they’ve measured with the same rig gives a fairly accurate idea of how these are tuned. I think you’re underselling them massively. 

I think you give lots of great advice in this sub, and I believe you when you hear the H3Pro as muddy and sharp… but on balance, and to my ears, I’m yet to find a better wireless headset.",my2dumbledores,1.0

Which I have mentioned in many of my reviews 

The Penrose is very comfortable on my head even if I have to really extend it far. It comes down to what your sensitive to. I'm not as clamp sensitive as many. Comfort isn't as simple as big head means ouch. It's far more nuanced than that. If pressure spots, shape of the ear cups mixed with clamp force and clamp design, distribution and so much more.

Extrapolating measurement from one rig to another isn't exactly how Hats work. Especially when sound guys targets have no accuracy really as it's not an industry standard or anything. You can't just look at a headphone on 2 different rigs and extrapolate how all others will sound on both as they have vastly different acoustic interactions. Again, like with the comfort thing, it's just not that simple. Let alone pinna differences, bass differences from head to head. 

Penrose, alpha wireless, barracuda pro, are all better sounding products.

The H3 pro hybrid may be comfort able (uneven clamp distribution), and has alot of features. But it's dynamic dull, it's tuned poorly, very low resolution, large placement variation, vastly overpriced. Sound wise it's just nothing special and doesn't come close to sounding close to its price point.

An if all you care about is comfort over sound, there are many poor sounding cheap headsets that are comfortable. The H3 pro doesn't do anything to justify its price tag.",LifelongCaboose,1.0

Both of these things cannot be true! Even little Techne on YT has to use wicked cushions on his Penrose to make 'em bearable.

Also, I mentioned extrapolating data between different headphones measured by Soundguys on the same rig. Which happens to be a $40,000 piece of kit from B&K.Yes, Harman was derived on a GRAS setup, but SG's compensation graph provides a rough approximation of how their B&K target compares to Harman ([here](https://sgatlas.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/consumer-curve-vs-harman-1000x656.jpg)).

Anyway, I don't want to talk in circles. I still think discounting the H3Pro Hybrid is silly, but it is strange/unlikely that you've just had two bad units.

I'll contact Oratory1990 about measuring my set so we can get some Gras measurements for comparisons sake. They ARE a little muddy and a bit bright, but nothing too offensive to my ears. Certainly not for gaming anyway.  


\*edit\* AGREED they are overpriced. True of most wireless kit nowadays. I got mine for 45% off on Prime day, so this would definitely be affecting my view.",my2dumbledores,1.0

But I have no issue with comfort on it. The Mobius has been my go to portable for years now. The clamp eases up alot.

Yes they attempt to offer a approximation of Harman but it does not do a great job of it. Even Harman is struggling to get a good Harman curve for 5128. Though there are 2 people who will have a much better curve soon. But sound guys struggle to produce transparent measurements constantly. Doesn't matter that they spent $40,000 if the research behind there target and constancy of there methodology is lacking a bit.

Oratory1990 would happily measure your unit if you send it his way. He now uses Gras kemar, an I do fear there may be some seal issues, with the epos H line. But they does tons of seatings thankfully.

Sadly I couldn't get a long term unit in so I couldn't measure it, but I did do a long enough listen.",LifelongCaboose,1.0

Oh yeah, I have every pad known to man (Dekoni, Yaxi, Brainwavz, WC's and more) but they all just gather dust now. I'm yet to find one which didn't completely destroy the tonal balance.  
BUT, it also shows how people will often priorities comfort over sound. We really need to champion headsets which can manage both.
