It's physically narrower, that much seems obvious. How it affects comfort is unknown, as it's a completely different type of headband, not just a narrowed version of the previous design. I don't expect this design to sacrifice comfort. This series is one of Sony's prime golden gees in an ever fiercer competition market. Allowing design changes that significantly conpromises user comfort for a large portion of potential customers, would be a huge no-no. Especially in this market as it is, because user comfort is one big area where Bose is still ahead of Sony in this market segment. Sony allowing that gap to further widen would be a huge mistake. That would push even more potential customers towards Bose instead, decrese sales and ROI for Sony despite their electronics improvements both in their own right and versus what Bose offers. Because no amount of top shelf electronics is gonna save a product that is uncomfortable to use. This would allow Bose a strong chance to catch up in the electronics department while Sony ""is stuck"" spending much of the work on the next version addressing selfinflicted wounds (comfort issue).",prollie,1.0

General consensus seems to be that the Bose line and Sony XM line are pretty great. The sound core q30s also have decent reviews for the price.

You have to understand an audiophile sits down and listens to music at a chair, in their home, where it’s quiet. They don’t give a shit how a headphone looks. They want all the money to go to sound quality and durability. It’s hard to compare an audiophile pair of cans to something that’s portable. Where you might benefit from Bluetooth, ANC, and portability. I used to walk around when I was in college with my sennheisers but that 1) looked really stupid 2) were a pain to take around 3) couldn’t put the volume up too much because they were open back headphones.

Personally, If I’m traveling I use a pair of Koss Porta Pros or my galaxy buds and I’ve been seriously considering a pair of the XM4s for the plane. I just did a long flight sitting next to the wings and I don’t think I can do that again. Had to blast my earbuds which is super annoying.

If you’re interested in the audiophile space and understand the limitations of a pair of headphones for that domain buy a pair of KSC 75s (<$20-extremely portable, open ended), or a Phillips SHP 9500 ($70-less portable, open ended). If you can hear the difference then you’ll start a journey of enjoying music at the next level. If you can’t, walk away and be happy with your purchase.",Lava39,1.0

Also for this specific model you can largely ignore people saying that wireless headphones are ""disposable"". While they're not designed to be user serviceable it's entirely possible to replace the battery yourself in the future if you are willing to roll up your sleeves a bit. See my [comment above](https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1bsubco/comment/kxl6af7/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

Technology wise things may improve with future models like the ANC, feature, etc so these types of headphones can go ""outdated"" in that sense but they won't stop being what they are currently.

I think these headphones are fantastic and I will not even consider the XM6 when it comes out as the XM5 is so good, that I literally do not see a need or desire to upgrade when the time comes. With proper care and no undue force when putting on and removing them, they should last a long time and as far as the sound is concerned, I just love em. They may not be everyone's cup of tea but they sure are mine!

That said:

>a ton of bass **and treble** and scooped upper mids which made them very easy to listen to but not neutral. But they were also loud, **clear**, and had stronger dynamics. The XM5's have a little more midrange focus and clarity, not as much **sparkly treble boost**,

A ton of bass, sure, the XM4's are bass cannons. Perhaps it's just me, but I've never seen anyone describe them as having a ton of treble or having a sparkly treble boost either. In fact, the opposite is usually what I'd see (recessed treble), and I'd also have to say that my XM4's, without EQ, are super lacking in treble and ""sparkle.""

This is important because, if what you say is true, the XM5 have even less treble than the XM4, which already imo sorely lacks in that department.

It's above the upper mids and the 3-4k harshness area, and it's below the ""air"" range of 10k plus. It comes across as sparkle, or if you had a warm pair of headphones and boosted the 6-8k range kind of narrowly. That doesn't make them detailed or airy though.

I think if you look at Soundguys' curve, that's not far off. There's less of the treble sparkle and overall it sounds a little more like Harman, although a little more boosted in the low mids and bass.

I'll listen tonight against my K371 to see how that compares...vs the HD6xx it definitely seemed like there was more low mids and bass and less clarity in the highs, but it wasn't unpleasant.

As can be seen in the suggestions, the ""base sound"" has a little bit more treble, a bit less bass and is weaker in the mid/higher mid range. It's a very balanced sound imho for more quiet music, though lacking a little bit in presence, while the original XM4 sound was just muffled imho. Lacks a little bit of punch initially though. I find them much more round in comparison with or without EQ, goes a bit more into the Sennheiser Momentum direction now. The biggest difference for me is that the bass seems way more integrated in the soundstage now. I'd never upgrade them only for the sound though, the ANC is the biggest difference in direct comparison. Regarding comfort I'm still not so sure and need more time with them. Bit more side pressure and more sound isolation (which also means they feel hotter) could make them less comfortable, on the other hand there's a bit more space for the ears.

I have noticed that the XM5s' have far more variability with the ANC than the XM4s'. Putting the headband farther down my head is the difference between hearing my mouse clicking and near-dead silence. Similarly, this may differ depending on your head shape. 

Fortunately, the XM5s' are light enough that even putting them in an otherwise awkward location for comfort and ANC quality is fairly trivial. 

After they're adjusted properly though, I find ANC is far superior to the XM4s' in terms of low and mid cancellation, and cabin pressure. 

In fact, on the XM5s', I actually can't feel any ANC cabin pressure at all, which was my most immediate observation. Although, after 8 hours sitting with ANC on and a fan blasting to the right of me, I have occasionally found my right ear in mysterious pain. I'd imagine this is the result of prolonged exposure to attempted cancellation of >\~18khz. If you're over 25, this is probably a non-issue.",CHduckie,1.0

I'll need to play around with EQ and see how that goes too.

I wonder sometimes when people are talking about lack of treble they may actually be talking about a lack of upper mids, lower down in the frequency range. Often the same frequency range can be described as ""upper mids"" by one but ""treble"" by another. I don't have the XM4 overears, but I do have the XM4 TWS and their issue with sounding muted or muffled is more about too recessed upper mids (as in, inadequate pinna gain- the 3Khz bump) IMO than lack of treble.

Both the XM4 and XM5 have toggle switches for ANC, so depending on how they are set up in the store, it's possible the ANC was turned on or off, or the transparency mode was on or off. Also, there's like 20 different transparency settings, so if the setting was changed, it could allow some sound from the mics to bleed through.

Also, there's this adaptive setting that will automatically turn ANC on or off or transparency up and down. I disable that because I want to control it.

Anyways, I just dragged the XM4, XM5, and APM all into the same room (like mid comment I stopped and did this). I listened to all three with my air purifier fan on max. XM5 basically eliminated the noise, APM you could hear it more clearly, and XM4 was worse than the other two. Then I went into the bathroom and turned on a faucet. All three took some of the high end noise out but you could still hear some whooshing, but the XM5 was about half as loud as the XM4 and APM.

Noise cancelling works great.  
>  
>(...)

What about the background noise on the mic though? I'd like to confirm there is no misunderstanding here. Noise cancelling may be working great indeed, but only for you - meaning on the headphones but not the mic.

The effect is so that you (the one wearing ANC headphones) does not hear the background noise at all. However the other people on the call hear it a lot. I had this a lot with the WH-1000XM3. Like i.e. people on a call with me could not hear me well but heard a lot my wife who was talking over a phone next to me. What makes it even worse, I was unaware as for me the headphones ANC kept my wife's voice barely noticeable.

So have you ever tried actually this on the XM5s: that there is a lot of noise near you (ideally including other people talking) and whoever is on the other side of the call, remains undisturbed with this background noise on your side?

As for the fact the noise is cancelled well for you, there is no doubt about this. This works well even with the XM3s.

There are extra factors here to consider. Like MS Teams has built-in software layer of input noise cancelling (from the mic). So to properly conduct Sony's mic noise cancelling test, ideally that should be disabled in the MS Teams Device Settings.

Given how crappy this is on the XM3s, I am quite sceptical about XM5s mic noise cancelling too. Also because most of the opinions/reviews conflate these two - headphones vs mic noise cancelling. Sometimes a reviewer may simply remain unaware, as I was myself for quite a bit.

1. you need to actually have a significant background noise
2. be one the call at the same time
3. have the person/people you talk to asked about how much noise from your side they can hear

Not many reviews are conducted with all of the points at once. Also many people, who you talk to on daily basis (Teams calls, etc.) would not complain about the noise coming from your side until you ask them about it. Or they will complain only when the noise really is to the level of a nuisance.

In other words, are you certain the noise cancelling on the XM5s works well or you just haven't fully checked it? As not fully checking by any of the below:

* there is not much noise around, like no one else talking in the same room, when you are on calls
* you haven't asked your team about the background noise in particular, but only how well they can hear you
* software noise cancelling did the job (Mac's built-in or MS Teams, or whatever you could use with such capabilities)

With XM3s I've ended up connecting extra boom mic and using dedicated noise cancelling software to have the proper level of noise cancelling on the mic. I am yet to find a headset on the market which would combine both: good noise cancelling on my ears and on my mic. Before I throw hefty sum on the XM5, would be good to know does it actually do it.",tamashumi,1.0

First, there aren't too many physical shops that stock a large number of high end headphones. Second, you really want to try them out with a range of music that you listen to, so it takes some time. Third, the store environment may be different from where you'll be using them, so especially for open back headphones, the ambient sound makes a lot of difference. Fourth, you want to try them out with your setup (source/DAC/amp) which is different from the store setup.

So you need to figure a few things out:

1. Budget
2. Open or closed back
3. Driver type (planar magnetic or dynamic or electrostatic)
4. Desired sound signature

The sound signature you'll want for mastering/producing (neutral) will be different from what you might want for different kinds of music or for gaming. Also, you need to decide if you're ok with eq-ing or not.

One other thing to think about is that while sound signature is really important, don't discount comfort as a factor.

Most people just have experience with closed back headphones, so open back headphones where you can hear everything around you as if you weren't wearing headphones is an unusual experience. Open backs generally give the widest sound stage and have an easier time with detail since they don't have to deal with reflections off of the closed back. If you will be using them in a quiet environment, open back are generally better. But if you're in an office environment, on the go, or otherwise in a noisy environment, then you'll want closed back.

  
Most headphones are dynamic. Planar magnetics are more rare and known for their ""fast"" response. Electrostatic are very rare and generally expensive.

  
You can learn a lot about your own preferences by just eq-ing a pair of headphones that you have (or the XM5's). You can tune them for a warm signature (suppress treble, boost bass), neutral (follow Harmon curve), V-shaped (boost treble and bass), etc. But if you go down this rathole, expect to sometimes get some headphones that you eventually want to sell (don't like sound or upgrade). That's why sites like headfi have such an active buy/sell forum.

  
There are some good sites for ""budget"" audiophile recommendations. A lot of people like Zeos. While his recommendations are usually good, his review style is a bit long winded to me and the anime girls stuff is cringey. InnerFidelity was good before they were bought out and the original author retired. But they still have a lot of good informative articles etc. Crinacle is good for IEM stuff, but that's a whole different rathole.

  
For places to start looking for stuff to buy, generally the Drop related stuff is decent as are some of Monoprice's headphones.",grendelone,2.0

I love the ANC of course, but at home I just want to hear what's going on around me in case my phone / doorbell rings or something else happens.

Personally I absolutely swear by the AirPods Pro 2 but from everything I've heard about the Max, it's overhyped and overpriced. I may reevaluate when the Max 2 comes out but I sort of lost interest when they were marked up by $95 in Canada, and then I started hearing more about them and permanently lost interest. I like that the Sonys are USB C, and work in wired mode without needing to be powered. I like all the extra configuration in the app, particularly the equalizer—I customized mine a lot and am very happy with how it sounds.

sony wh-1000xm5,headphones,AirPods Max vs. Sony WH-1000XM5: My Review,uxiprd,Protomize,https://i.redd.it/h35qaokoum191.jpg,1001,218,1653489197.0,"Comparing these to my AirPods Max…  
  
Sony has been Bose's nightmare since the year 2016 when they introduced the MDR-1000x. Until then, Bose had a stranglehold on the ANC headphone market since no other headphone was quite as effective at cancelling noise. Fast forward to now and Bose has been losing more and more to Sony with every new iteration of the WH or WF series. Apple joined the ANC headphone market in the year 2020 with the AirPods Max and those have been my go-to in this category.  
  
The XM5s are bit controversial in terms of storage and travel due to their inability to collapse and fold into a small form factor similar to the previous Sony WH series. Sony likely took this new design route to remove the weakest point in a headphone. There were numerous complaints of previous WH iterations cracking at the point where the headband folds so hopefully this new design choice is more durable. The Bose NC 700 and AirPods Max also adopt this design where there is no folding.  
  
The feel and build quality of the XM5s is no match for the AirPods Max, but the XM5s is not cheap. However, this much lighter design thanks to the materials chosen results in supreme comfort whereas the AirPods Max shows its weight after an hour or two on my head. The AirPods Max feel like their price tag although it doesn’t translate too well in terms of listening comfort for some users. Definitely recommend testing headphones out at your local electronics store if possible. Comfort can make or break them.  
  
The case is much better on the XM5s in comparison to the AirPods Max. They completely cover the headphone and also have a compartment to hold the 3.5mm analog cable as well as the USB-C cable. The AirPods Max case on the other hand has no compartment to hold extra cables and leaves the headband exposed to scratches and tears if you throw them in a busy bag. The AirPods Max case is literally really only useful to power off the headphones.  
  
Battery life is superb on the XM5s at 30 hours or 40 hours with no ANC/Transparency activated. You can also get 3 hours of charge in 3 minutes if using a USB-C PD equipped power adapter. Insane! The AirPods Max has a 20-hour battery life which is inferior to the XM5s on paper but still more than enough for me since all I needed was 8-10 hours of run time to get me through the office for the day. The XM5s charge via the more standard and easily accessible USB-C connection while the AirPods Max uses a lightning connection which might not be an issue if you have an iPhone since that is what is needed to charge that as well. The XM5s can also operate passively from the 3.5mm analog port using the included cable in the event the battery completely dies. Do keep in mind, the sound will not be as good as when it is powered due to the electronics not actively EQ’ing out the deficiencies of the driver. The AirPods Max do not operate at all when their power is depleted. Neither support USB-DAC audio.  
  
App support is a landslide victory to the XM5s with the ability to manually update the headphone, adjust EQ, set listening modes based on activity or location, view listening habits, adjust playback and ambient mode controls, etc. It’s an extensive list of customizations that the XM5s allows. The AirPods Max on the other hand are only really customizable on an iOS device through the Bluetooth settings and even then, there’s far less customization. So, while the XM5s work well with both iOS and Android, the AirPods Max is only worth considering if you have an iPhone.  
  
ANC performance between the two are both excellent and you can’t go wrong with either. It’s like picking hairs trying to find a winner here. Sometimes I feel like the AirPods Max blocks out more noise (particularly in the lower frequencies) and sometimes I think it’s the XM5s that win (particularly in the higher frequencies). It really depends on the environment but I will confidently say these are the best two ANC headphones on the market. Moving over to transparency mode and I find that the AirPods Max slightly edges the XM5s in the sense of naturalness to the sound. It simply sounds more like I don’t have a headphone on my head with the AirPods Max more so than the XM5s which sound a tad bit processed. I can still however, easily hold conversations on my XM5s transparency mode with my co-workers at work or hear announcements on the train platforms.  
  
Call quality between the two is also excellent but the XM5s edge out the AirPods Max in the ability to literally make you sound like you’re in a quiet room despite there being wind or noises in the background. So, while both headphones pick up your voice clearly, the XM5s blocks out background noises better. It’s honestly amazing because the previous Sony WH iterations were mediocre in terms of microphone performance but now Sony is the king in this department. Great job!  
  
Lastly, the sound. I love em’ both. I would describe the XM5s as warm. There’s less emphasis in the treble and particularly the upper treble in comparison to the AirPods Max. The XM5s midrange also has more fullness to it which makes the overall sound more in your face and vivid. This is great to reduce listening fatigue over time but sometimes can hurt the clarity of the mix. Thankfully, the XM5 has the ability to EQ the tuning using its app. The XM5s bass is much, much improved over the XM4 and now sounds very tactile, precise and still full of oomph and power. The AirPods Max bass is more emphasized in the sub bass, with a flatter and more neutral mid to upper bass response and also has a precise and tactile sounding bass profile. The XM5s bass is more mid-bass focused so you get more of that punchy feel. Personally, I prefer a sub bass boost, with flatter mid-bass and upper bass to prevent blooming into the midrange. Soundstage between the two is great but the AirPods Max sounds a bit airier and spacious even after EQ'ing the XM5s. Details and subtle nuances sound a tad easier to hear on the AirPods Max as a result as well. The XM5 is still no slouch and music sound very detailed and clear despite the warmer turning which just shows how well controlled the XM5s speaker is in its transient response. So, while the AirPods Max is the more neutral and slightly clearer sounding option, the XM5s is the more punchy and smooth option. The XM5s max volume is louder than AirPods Max and neither of them distort near or at their max volume which is a major issue I have with Bose headphones and earphones. All in all, I can live with either the AirPods Max or XM5 in terms of sound, but if I had to choose, my preference is the AirPods Max because I tend to prefer a more accurate and spacious sound. Like stated before, the XM5 can be EQ'd to sound neutral but the soundstage still lacks a bit to the AirPods Max. Soundstage can't be EQ'd since it's an inherent part of the physical speaker design. A quick mention is that I find that the XM4 sounds overly bright and boomy in comparison to the AirPods Max or XM5 even after endless attempts of trying to EQ them using the app. Sony really improved the quality of sound on the XM5 and they are the best sounding yet in the WH lineup.  
  
In conclusion, the AirPods Max and Sony XM5 are at the top. It really boils down to this despite the differences between the two... If you have an iPhone, get the AirPods Max. If you have an Android phone, get the Sony XM5s.",Protomize,324.0

I have the XM2’s and looking to upgrade at this point (or maybe keep if my wife will use it on long flights) and got both the XM5’s and APM to try with the intention of keeping one. I use Apple devices (iPhone, iPad, Mac).

Biggest issue I had with the XM2’s were comfort as the headband creates a pressure point on the top of my head and that ANC isn’t quite as top notch as the best of the best these days and has a very slight hissing sound, though basically disappears or imperceptible once music is played at sufficient volume. However sound quality wise I love the XM2’s. They are detailed and well balanced with good oomph in the bass that’s well controlled. I never understood how all the “professional reviews” thought the XM4’s sounded great because to me they sound bloated and muddy. Funny how some reviewers are only acknowledging this now in their XM5 reviews now that the new model is out.

The XM5’s do sound much better than the XM4’s with way tighter bass and less bloat. Also more comfortable, with better mics. However with default EQ they still sound a little bloated but do clean up decently with a bit of adjustment in the app and so props to Sony for the good EQ. They are also much more comfortable than the XM2’s but still create a bit of a pressure point in the headband. The ear cups and clamping is perfect though. The APM clamp harder, but the mesh headband system distributes the weight much better with no pressure so for me the APM wins on comfort. I can see how others may find the XM5 more comfortable however if they don’t have the pressure point issue. 

Sony’s ANC on the XM5 is amazing. I feel it is the best of any I’ve heard and slightly better than the APM. I feel they passively block a bit more than the APM and maybe that’s why they’re top. APM is pretty close though and neither creates cabin pressure for me. Also echo your points on mic call quality, case, battery life etc which the XM5’s win out on.

Sound wise however I think the APM are pretty incredible. The soundstage and airiness is very impressive for Bluetooth closed back headphones and much better than the XM5’s. The latter EQ nicely and can sound very good but they still can’t replicate what the APM’s do. Genuinely impressed how lively everything sounds on these, detailed and spacious.

One other thing that’s worth mentioning is given these all have a finite life due to battery degradation over time, the APM’s can have the battery replaced for $79 at Apple. As far as I know Sony don’t offer battery replacement but someone can correct me if that’s not right. Otherwise you will have to go the DIY route which frankly I wouldn’t do and reckon many others won’t either.

Lastly the APM work great with the H1 chip and the auto switching and spatial audio feature if you use Apple devices.

I’m leaning towards keeping the APM and sending back the XM5’s but will keep testing them out for another week to be sure.

TLDR: Agee pretty much fully with your review having tried both headphones. Trying to decide which to keep but given I use Apple devices and think the APM sound a little better leaning towards those. The XM5’s are excellent though and can’t go wrong with them either.",sft007,3.0

The MX5 has a 3.5mm jack and can play CD or close to CD quality. I know Apple has redefined compression to be an art form, to the point where you’ll never know the difference. However if I’m taking the time to rip CD’s and pay for high quality, I’d like to play it. Weight was a huge factor for me, huge! Apple has always defined premium by weight and I’ve learned in the headphone space that doesn’t translate. The MX5 is air and the fact that they can do that and get that sound should let anyone know how beautiful crafted and engineered those cans are. I do like the AP Max sound signature a tad better but comfort trumps that to the ground. If they ever make an APMax that’s light weight and sounds like that it’s game over for all other ANC headphones.",chum_slice,4.0

They definitely deliver on sound signature, but I'm really considering returning them. It's the goddamn *headband.* It may not seem like they took much padding out of it, but for some reason, it causes me so much pressure on the top of my head. I notice it within minutes and within an hour I'm actively uncomfortable wearing them. I've tried adjusting the fit every which way but nothing works.

Being able to toss it in a bag or whatever is fine, but one of the big failure points of the XM4 turned out to be that the joint between cup and band was prone to snapping when a piece became loose, it was something that only seemed to manifest after a year or so of heavy use, was also how mine died.

I’m quite curious about instrument separation and how the AirPods Max and the WH XM5s compare. 

I do agree that the AirPods Max is more neutral, with more detail, better-controlled bass, and a much wider soundstage compared to the Sony WH XM4s. However I felt that the Sony had better instrument separation and placement, whereas instrument lines blend together on the AirPods Max (despite the extra detail) that it created a left and right wall of sound effect. I imagine the WH XM5 should do better than, if not as good as, the WH XM4 on instrument separation. Could you comment on that?

Obviously it is not fair to compare earbuds to headphones, but I thought the Sony WF XM4 earbuds had a similar tonal response to the AirPods Max, far better than the WH XM4. Still, I found that the Sony WF XM4 earbuds had far more detail and shockingly far better instrument separation than either headphone, with the bass quality of the AirPods Max - sub-bass emphasis, tactile, fast and well-defined.",boildler,1.0

There is no ability to set anything to the quick access double tap. Only Spotify.

MX3 
Pros more codecs and some audio effects

XM4
multi device paring, loses codecs and some of the effects.

Xm5 - new style, and better calls. 

XM5 has the best anc but not to the degree i’d make a purchase decision it.  IMO try to get xm4 on sale, like 200 or so. (it’s been there before and about what i paid). If you need calls wait for xm5 after price drops. (if you are price sensitive like me).

IMO the Apple one is fine if you can tolerate the apple “Controls” and the price. I’ve not entirely convinced its’ justified. I think most people will reach for the sony as well due to weight and versitility, that’s just a hunch though. 

THE TLDR for me is both APPLE (especially) and Sony to some degree have over priced  these. Time will tell. Bose is still the most comfortable, makes great calls and I feel the anc is pretty close, it does with things a little differently. The sound signature to me is not as much to my liking.

I managed to get them for 400 brand new open box at Best Buy it kind of hurt considering how much of a discount I got. But I found the xm5s on eBay from a reputable refurbished seller for 260 so that’s why I have the xm5s. I do miss the wider sound stage from the APM and definitely the low profile with the great build quality. I do think the APM were a little more comfortable due to the headband being wider so didn’t create a pressure point unlike the Sony’s but so far I’ve got used to it so it’s not as bad and definitely can wear my Sony’s for a lot longer after just 3 days of using them. Really liking the xm5s rn especially with the eq! In my opinion if the APM were around 300 I would honestly had kept them. Just the build quality and the wider sound stage I kind of miss. But overall not disappointed with my xm5s at all! The eq settings definitely make it better and I do think the ANC is much better! I’ll definitely be buying the next generation APM tho and hopefully they fix the main problems like a usb c charging, power button (definitely sucked not being able to fully turn them off), maybe a 3.5 mm jack or atleast a connection to use when dead, and probably the biggest one is adding a new codec for sound as well as eq that would definitely seal the deal for me but one can only dream:)",devintejeda1234,1.0

It’s not night in day. Sound is subjective though. I’ll leave it to you to sort say what you like better. The new ones are a little more detailed. The anc is a little better. 

The big benefit to me is the call quality is finally good. 

If you don’t need that i’d listen to both (amazon and return if ya don’t like it). At sale time you can get the xm4 for 170.  I paid i beleve about that price on some verizon deal a couple years ago. I have my mx4 for work, and use my xm3 at home and work out with them. 

Both are bullet proof. I still use the mx3 every day for hours and sleep in them. Changed the battery twice. IF you asked me what i would do the difference is only 50 and you are paying full retail i’d get the new ones. But i wouldn’t do that. I’d wait for a steep discount.

The WH-1000XM5… was a little underwhelming. Tonality wise, I felt that Sony really tried to move towards the sound of the AirPods Max. The bass was punchy, aggressive, and mid-bass focused as you said! It was deeper and tighter than that of the WH XM5, but still not quite as deep or well-defined as the bass on the AirPods Max (or Sony’s own WF XM4 earbuds - not a fair comparison, but still.) I also thought that the XM5 bass was a little disjointed from the rest of the sound.

One of my favorite parts about the WH XM4 sound is its upper midrange boost and treble presence, even if it isn’t terribly detailed. The WH XM5 does away with the lower treble, but more severely the upper treble. It almost felt like hearing loss. I did not like the APM’s de-emphasis of upper mids and lower treble, and I didn’t think this was any better.

I thought the technical ability of the WH XM5 is on about the same level as the APM or the WH XM4, with the APM having the most spacious soundstage and macrodetail, and the XM5 with the best instrument separation (still mediocre). APM and WH XM5 tied for transient response. Not sure about dynamics.

I’m a Sony fan, but I will have to say that the WH-1000XM5 is a miss. For now, I’d still reach for my WF-1000XM4 earbuds for good sound in a wireless package + NC.

With that said, I read your sound quality again, I find it to be very much agreeable especially when doing comparisons. Thanks for the review!",boildler,2.0

However...there aren't really any nouns ending with S that you would pluralise. You wouldn't say 'Physicses' because having multiple physics isnt really thing; you wouldn't say 'molasseses' because molasses is plural in nature as it describes a liquid substance.

When it comes to model names then, my (brief) research into this indicates that you'd treat them like human names - so many people called Chris would be multiple Chris's; but something belonging to Chris would be 'Chris' headphones'.

Confusingly, you could would also use 's on a name as a contraction of 'is' - so 'Chris is coming' would be 'Chris's coming' - although generally contractions are avoided when names end with an S.

Multiple XM5s

One iPhone 5S

Multiple iPhone 5S's

App belonging to an iPhone 5S - iPhone 5S' app

I agree with Sassywhat though - brands like Sony don't make it easy. But, most of the time in any language, you can pick up the correct intent from the context - it should be pretty easy to see the difference between multiple XM5s and the new shiny XM5s micro-headphone",colourofsound,3.0

I did have the original Momentum Wireless at some point years ago which I liked. Honestly can’t remember why I sold them and got the XM2’s instead.

if you're captioning a photo, sure. if you're reading a comment where either one might be discussed and someone brings up ""xm5s sound quality"", is it obvious?

there's nothing wrong with breaking the ""rules"" (language doesn't actually work that way though) in order to be clearer.",blastfromtheblue,2.0

It'd be ""XM5's sound quality"" 

The issue is: are people going to use the correct grammar?

...No. 

No they're not.

Not sure I agree with you on the comment about rules - language \*does\* work that way precisely because of the rules put in place. The rules exist to prevent confusion - although ironically (and clearly evident by this discussion) they can cause more problems than they solve.

Also - grammar is part of [linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics) rather than [language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language); and therein lies the problem - attempting to physically note down sounds and intentions is really hard. Fascinating stuff; it's all good fun.

the whole purpose of language is to facilitate the communication of ideas. if the person you’re talking to understands what you meant them to, you’re never wrong. and if you departed from established convention to make your point clearer, rather than “breaking rules” it would be more apt to say you’ve “transcended convention”.",blastfromtheblue,1.0
