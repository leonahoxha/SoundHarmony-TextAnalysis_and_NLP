I found the headphones only switched between normal mode and transparency mode when using the button. Had to use the app to switch into noise canceling. It’s not perfect, but it’s damn impressive for a $150 headphone. 

They have a fun V shaped sound to me, only issue is a dip around 3khz. I made a custom eq that just puts 3k at +6db, mostly fixes it, or at least fixes it enough to make them a good mobile option for me.",ris3nda3mon,3.0

soundcore space q45,headphones,Opinion on Soundcore Space Q45?,19eiqv3,PaceTry,https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/19eiqv3/opinion_on_soundcore_space_q45/,2,7,1708515881.0,"I've had the Q30s for almost a year and I've been pretty happy with them, but the cover of one of the foam pads started to peel. I got the option for a refund, so I thought I'd get the Q45s for an ""upgrade"".

I got them some hours ago. I'm extremely disappointed so far. In my usual setting (at home), the ANC is worse than normal mode. I can hear a hissing when it's on. Sound quality also seems to be way worse. I'm waiting for them to charge a bit and then I'll update them and try again

Multipoint seems to be also worse than with my Q30. Pairing/connecting takes like 5x as much, and for a moment I wasn't able to enable media playback on my android phone, even after disconnecting them from my PC and even forgetting the device and pairing again.

Something else I noticed with the ANC is that it's slower to respond, and I can hear some weird sudden volume changes. That might be related to some new settings that weren't present on the Q30.

I really hope something improves after some tweaking, but I'm 99% sure I'll return them and either get new Q30s or something else. Q30s were fine... cheap material quality, but for the price I guess it's reasonable.

The only improvements I noticed from the Q30s are:

-They're a bit more comfortable

-The announcer woman voice doesn't pause playback every time it sounds.

  
UPDATE: I've just updated the Q45s to the last firmware version, and even enabled LDAC and played a lot with the EQ settings. No chance. I can't understand how could anyone find them better sounding than the Q30s. It's not only the lack of bass, but the overall definition in all frequencies. And the ANC... it might work better in other louder settings which I didn't try, but it's insane that they actually produce noise when the room is already silent. With the Q30s, ANC is more silent than Normal mode, always.",_cyb3r_,1.0

Lithium-ion battery failures are nothing new and everyone should be aware that they can happen. There's plenty of videos of exploding vapes, e-scooters, etc. They are rare, but they do happen. They're more likely to happen with very cheap products or with very cheap chargers (the chargers are a bit less likely because a good product should have over voltage and over current protection...or at least over current. These can happen from physical damage, shorts, manufacturing defects, water damage, etc.

Keep in-mind that the vast majority of consumer electronics with lithium ion batteries have off-the-shelf batteries that are not made by the brand of the actual device.

No brand is immune to this. Again, you don't typically need to worry, especially when buying decent-quality electronics, but everyone should be aware that this can happen.

If you want to avoid the slightest chance, then I guess don't use lithium ion batteries.

Most electronics like this will use off-the-shelf batteries because these brands are not also battery manufacturers, so you might buy some other brand and get the exact same battery that was in this particular unit. Typically, these issues are extremely rare with decent brand-name products (they'll use decent batteries and implement protections like over-voltage and over-current protection).

I just read the [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_Note_7) on the Note 7 as it's been long enough that I don't remember the details. It looks like the 1st batch had an issue with Samsung's own battery design (so that's more of a design testing failure than a QC failure, but also would fall to the realm of QC once the issue was discovered post-launch). The 2nd round of issues appears to be from the 2nd battery vendor Samsung used, who had manufacturing defects which they claim was from trying to ramp up production so quickly. That's definitely a QC failure, though that QC would fall more to the battery vendor than Samsung. Apparently that vendor was also used for iPhones (not sure which models exactly).

The Note 7 is an interesting example for sure, as it seems like there were multiple semi-unrelated failures and by the time they could've been addressed, public opinion was so low that it made more financial sense to EOL the product.",AudioMan612,4.0

I don't blame anyone for not wanting to be a guinea pig and preferring to play it safe, and I definitely wouldn't encourage anyone to ignore something like this, but it would be more prudent to research if there is a significant number of cases.

The brand I work for has had this happen on extremely rare occasion. Of the millions of units sold in the 5 years I have worked at my current job, I have seen less than I can count on 1 hand. Any decent brand will treat issues like this extremely seriously (as did we).

One other variable is using good quality chargers. Sure, a good product should still have good protection circuits to help deal with dangerous issues, but man, some of those off-brand USB chargers out there are absolute trash that shouldn't be allowed on the market. Save a few bucks here, but likely reduce your battery capacity faster.

As far as ""due diligence in sourcing batteries"" goes, how do you know they didn't (they more than likely did)? And we don't even know if the battery was the root cause, or another component failure leading to the battery going into thermal runaway. Perhaps Anker cheaped-out on protection circuitry, which would absolutely be on them, but perhaps this 1 unit got a bad power component (which again, more than likely not made by Anker). Or, perhaps the battery had been bulging for a while, but OP hadn't noticed it, and this was the outcome. There isn't a major expensive brand out there where you can't find plenty of cases of bulging batteries. Sony, Apple, whatever. There's just too many variables to conclude that Soundcore products have a higher chance of catastrophic battery failure than other brands from 1 Reddit post. As you pointed out, Anker is known for their high-quality battery packs, and they didn't get that reputation by having a bunch of fires and explosions (though they likely have completely different teams working on their audio products and there's a good chance they are using completely different battery vendors).

I don't blame you for not wanting to use Anker headphones. I don't work for them, but even if I did, I wouldn't care. I understand the feeling. I'm just trying to say that as someone who works in product development in consumer electronics, this 1 case on its own doesn't mean very much.",AudioMan612,20.0

If you're looking for some good ANC over-ear headphones, you might want to check out Sony. Both the WH-1000XM4 and WH-1000XM5 are on-sale right now. There are few products that compete at that level.",AudioMan612,1.0

The W600BT and WH700NB seem really good based on the Amazon reviews. Just trying to decide if the ANC is worth the extra weight.,Eclectic_Lynx,1.0
soundcore space q45,headphones,My Soundcore Q45 melted,17s0z3a,quincy-,https://i.redd.it/lbfa1f2rwhzb1.jpg,932,165,1700813566.0,"> WH700NB

The difference in weight is likely more from the larger battery in the WH700NB. ANC uses a fair amount of power, and even with ANC on, the WH700NB has substantially better battery life. That difference is likely at least partially due to a larger battery (though it possible that the WH700NB just has a more efficient chipset; just less likely).

Weight alone doesn't tell you much.There are other variables that come into play, especially how good the headband distributes the weight. For example, if the headband stretches in a way that only a tiny spot in the middle actually makes contact with your head, then you'll experience a pressure point. My primary headphones ([Dan Clark Ether Flow 1.1](https://danclarkaudio.com/catalog/product/view/_ignore_category/1/id/30/s/ether-flow/)) are much heavier than both of these headphones, and are insanely comfortable no matter how long I wear them. My old [Sennheiser HD 700](https://global.sennheiser-hearing.com/products/hd-700)'s are a similar weight and even more comfortable. My [Audeze LCD-X](https://www.audeze.com/products/lcd-x) however...not the most comfortable due to weight lol.

A few other variables relating to comfort are clamping force, materials, and the form factor (open-back vs closed-back, though you won't find open-back ANC headphones lol).

Also, the WH700NB appear to have metal sliders while the W600BT has plastic ones. That has the potential for considerably better durability (we are talking very cheap products in this product class at this point, so don't expect amazing build quality).

ANC is a pretty major feature, especially if you have use for it. You can always turn it off when you don't want it.

There is one advantage to the W600BT: it supports a wired 3.5mm connection if this is important to you.",AudioMan612,1.0

> The Anker Soundcore Space Q45 sound quality is probably the headset’s biggest issue. It’s not all terrible, most users will get used to the headset’s sound after a few minutes of use, but it doesn’t hold up next to other options on the market. The frequency response curve deviates noticeably from our ideal target curve across all areas of the frequency spectrum. The sub-bass is slightly exaggerated, the midrange depressed slightly, and the higher frequencies are besieged by an undulating change in response that causes high-end elements in music to sound hissy, betraying the accuracy of the playback.",guesswhochickenpoo,3.0

Check if your headphone volume is also turned up, they may not be synced.

It’s the limitation of the driver. 

I got them about a month or so ago in the hopes of just leaving them at work since I didn’t want to leave my Momentum 4s there and don’t like my buds hanging from my ears all day. But they just didn’t sound good enough to mask the lack of features. They weren’t as veiled as the XM4/XM5s, but their clarity wasn’t good and the imaging even worse. So I returned them and replaced them with the AKG Y600NC which were on sale around that time. The AKGs sound damn near the same as the Q45s, but they have the auto pause feature when you remove your headphone which the Q45 doesn’t have.",DaVillageLooney,2.0

But a lot of perceived bass slam and impact actually comes from the treble, and the ratio of the bass to the midrange ""meat"" of the music can also disproportionately affect bass quantity perception.

After adding 5 dB centered at 100 Hz, I'd try raising the upper treble frequencies past 10 kHz or so by 5 dB. If I couldn't use a high shelf and needed to pick a frequency to center the boost at with a bell-shaped filter, I'd specifically pick 16 kHz. If that's not enough, I would try either decreasing 500 Hz or 1000 Hz by 3-5 dB, depending on whether I wanted a V-shaped or a U-shaped sound signature.

Try installing PowerAmp EQ if the Soundcore app doesn't allow for that level of fine-tuning. Parametric mode has a steeper learning curve than graphical but will give you better results if the latter doesn't work well for you. If you use parametric EQ, you'll want to use a low shelf for the bass, a high shelf for the treble, and bell filters for the midrange.",dongas420,1.0

Because I wanted to upgrade to buying the newest style of headphones currently on amazon, I chose the soundpeats space, which has many vine customers giving it very good reviews on Amazon.  
  
Price: $55.99. It's on deal now, and there's a 10% off coupon.  
  
Build quality: It's mostly plastic, but durable and stable, won't fall of my head.  
  
Sound quality: These headphones come with an AUX cable, and I prefer soundpeats to soundcore for the using experience. The music feels immersive, wrapping around my head. They also sound clean and pure, everything sounds balanced.  
  
The battery life is 123 hours, which is great, I don't have to travel with a pair of undercharged headphones all the time because I'm worried I'll forget to charge them.  
  
Comfort: The ear cup material is very comfortable and not annoying to wear.
