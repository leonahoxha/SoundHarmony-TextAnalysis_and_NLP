bose quietcomfort ultra,headphones,Bose QuietComfort Ultra: Bose Engineers have lost their minds,1b2dc0q,CreamyLibations,https://i.redd.it/uz4aobe2ddlc1.jpeg,39,22,1709145072.0,"Bose engineers have lost their minds: they finally tuned the mids on a pair of over-ear headphones correctly. Gone are the recessed, boxy vocals of the old QuietComfort series. Gone is whatever the hell they were doing with the NC700. The folks at Bose finally decided that, hey, maybe there's a reason other companies implement a fairly standard pinna gain for the upper mids, and they mostly followed suit.

I say mostly because there's still not *quite* enough pinna gain for my tastes, and the tonality isn't perfect -- snare drums in particular continue to be a weakness for this series. But for the first time in the history of Bose over ear headphones, I can listen to my entire library with these and be completely satisfied during my workday.

They're very comfortable, even with my thick glasses, and the ANC is so good that I actually had to turn it down a few notches to avoid feeling queasy. They're gonna be a hell of a travel companion for a bunch of long flights I have coming up, and I'm honestly just kind of shocked at the overall quality of the package.

Of course, there *is* too much bass for my tastes. Bose's app EQ is hilariously rudimentary, with just three sliders, but decreasing the bass slider by 5 notches brought it to a good level for me where it's still elevated and punchy but not distracting.

I'm not certain I'd pay the full MSRP because I'm cheap, but for the USD $300 I paid, I can't really complain at all. Well done, Bose. Please lose your minds more often.",CreamyLibations,25.0

An analog headset has 0ms latency, aside from the innate delay present in the sound card on the computer, and I imagine even wireless headsets built for gaming would be geared toward lower latency performance.

People have different preferences when it comes to sound signatures, such as bass-heavy, balanced, or treble-focused, and these preferences can significantly influence their choice of headphones. Additionally, factors like comfort, build quality, and the specific use case (e.g., for traveling, studio work, or casual listening) also play a crucial role in determining what makes a pair of headphones great for an individual.  
  
I think that the emotional connection and the memories associated with certain songs or genres can greatly enhance the listening experience, making it more about the feeling the music evokes than the technical specs of the headphones themselves. It's all about finding what works for you and what makes your music listening experience most enjoyable and fulfilling. Whether you're into cassette tape, streaming high-resolution audio, or just enjoying your favorite playlists on your phone, the key is to immerse yourself in the sound and let the music take you to your happy place.",useryournamehere,3.0

He does an awesome job of explaining/testing different categories of headphones and I dunno about other folks but he’s one of my favorite YouTubers when it comes to audio and other tech as well.  Also if you have a Guitar Center near you, they have a pretty decent selection of headphones you can try out that a lot of people (myself included) often overlook.  

Those Bose were a pretty solid choice for your price range.  Increasing it by about $50 and you could have gone into a little more “premium” range aka The Sony WH1000XM4, Beats Studio Pro, Sennheiser Momentum 4.

I know you said you didn’t like the XM4s at loud volume, so that’s fair enough.  

And I wonder which Beats you tried?  The reason I ask is because of how loud you state you like music and the Studio Pros, I’ve found, were really good at louder volume.  I wonder if they were the Solo3s (they have a more rounded ear cup) or the Studio3s, or the Studio Pros?  It’s kind of hard to tell the Studios apart visually but the Studio3s have “Studio3” written on the side band.  The Beats do get a lot of hate (I’ve already accepted the fact that I’m going to get downvoted for even mentioning them again) for being extra punchy in the bass and overpriced but the Studio Pros stood out from the pack recently as a pretty solid option.  And if you use an iPhone or iPad, even better.  They’ve also switched to USB-C for charging and audio output (and they still have an audio jack as well).  They have been compared up there with the AirPods Max as far as sound quality goes by several reviewers (Flossy Carter, Marques Brownlee, and UrAverageConsumer).  I feel like the Beats Studio Pro would have been almost a perfect fit for your use case.  I may sound like I’m trying to sell you on these but I wanted to give you another option in case you decide the Bose didn’t quite do it for you because of the low build quality or the battery life ends up putting you off within your return window.  They do run $299 at Best Buy but the Best Buy near me price matched Amazon for me at $229.  If they won’t, you can get them on Amazon for $229 and you’ll get them in three days if you have Prime.

But honestly, at your price range, you did a great job!  The QC45s were a very solid choice for a long time.  Just recently (within the past year or so) there have been other contenders who have released some really great headphones below the $300 mark.  

Also, this is big, but what kind of music do you typically listen to?  Sorry if you answered this previously but I didn’t see it and that could impact you choices one way or another drastically.",digital_bath12,-1.0

I work as a test engineer for a major gaming peripherals brand, and many audio products conform to the European EN50332 standard, which means that the maximum listening level cannot exceed 100 dB. It doesn't matter how much power the amp can produce; it will be capped in firmware. As someone that also has the unfortunate bad habit of listening at high levels, this limit isn't really great to me. I tend to run our products at or near max volume when testing (outside of things that are painful at those levels like test sweeps). I've been that guy at headphone conventions that gets comments about my listening levels with open-back headphones.

On the plus side, I use speakers far more than headphones these days, and I'm mostly at lower levels. I do blast headphones here and there though (or speakers if I can do so without bothering others). My hearing has somehow managed to survive this quite well.

Sound signature was really big thing for me. I wasn’t sure what type I exactly wanted, so I tried to at least aim for a great sound quality and good bass, but not muddling the mids and trebles.

I am a bass-head but I want to hear the trebles and mids in a rich manner, that was super important to me! Sony like I said blew me away with sound quality, but it was the most neutral in my opinion. JBL hits hard with bass, but has poorer sound quality. Bose was definitely it for me, I enjoy how loud they get and how well they support heavy bass. Also V, U, W shaped audio and etc was a thing I was learning about and tried to keep that into consideration!!

All the instruments, the lyrics, the vocals, the trebles and bass, everything that goes into a song, music is just absolutely beautiful! I grew up around spanish music as I’m puerto rican and black, and music seriously brings people together, no matter what race you are or what political values you have, music can bring so many together! That’s usually if I’m immersed in the music, which is why I like it to be a little on the loud side, or not so much as loud but I only want to hear the music and nothing else.

Sure, the sound isn't as good as something like my ZMF's, but its the noise canceling that is worth its weight in gold.  The noise canceling, combined with wireless, make them a set of heaphones you can use *anywhere*, even on an airplane (tried my ZMF's on a plane and it was a terrible experience, lol).  And because the noise cancellation is so good, you get a lot more headroom for volume since you aren't having to drown out ambient noise while listening.

Like someone else said they definitely improve with some basic EQing as well.

I used to listen to music at uncomfortable volumes when I was down as a teenager. I didn’t realize it at the time, but I was intentionally self harming. As a result I have permanent mild tinnitus.

An ENT can tell you whether or not you have existing hearing damage— it usually takes time to damage your hearing with headphones though. You won’t know until you have mild hearing damage, and neither will your ENT/audiologist.

For reference, the XM4s have a max volume of 105db to 114db via 3.5mm depending on the website sourced.
That is enough volume to cause hearing damage in around 30 to 10 minutes. Presumably you were listening to a wired demo unit that doesn’t have a loudness limiter.",landenone,6.0

Now music never sounds loud. Nothing sounds loud, the only thing getting louder is the high pitched ringing.

If your ENT knew that you listen to music on the loudest pair of headphones at 100% they would not be giving you such good feedback.

I'm glad you are pleased with your purchase, but the way you talk about listening at loud volumes reminds me of people who don't wear a seatbelt and say ""I haven't had a car crash""

Given that the bose control app only gives you vague ""Bass"" ""mid"" ""treble"" EQ sliders (because of tech-phobic boomers) I can't even see how I could make this NOT suck.
