For the squeeze to play/pause time, is it nearly instantenous or is there a slight delay.?

For example, my previous set was the galaxy buds pro (1st gen) with an S10+, and when I tapped the bud to pause, it took about 0.1-0.2s. When I used my galaxy buds on my Oneplus 11, I measured a 1.2-1.7s delay before it paused the music. This and the lower music quality (since OP does not have samsungs scalable codec), made me want to upgrade. 

&#x200B;

The lack of volume control is annoying (hopefully you can recommend some solution, beyond manually pressing the buttons on the phone), and I hope these headphones can stay in my ear when I go for light runs and do stair runs like my galaxy buds pros.

&#x200B;

If the LHDC or LC3 Codec support on the oneplus buds pro 2 sound better than the AAC on my galaxy buds, with better latency and squeeze responsiveness, I will be tempted to keep them.",AshM1999,1.0

Personally, I have moved on and decided that the only brand that I will move forward with will be Apple. Yes, I do not agree with a lot of things of the ecosystem, but after about 12 years of using Android, I cannot find anything that can compete with an iPhone, on all the aspects that do interest me. (Camera - main reason why I bought it, and in general the high quality parts and not cutting corners on stuff. i.e The mic on the Oneplus 7 pro was trash for video, though the phone was priced way lower that the iPhone from 2019).",trasimach,-1.0

If you like bass, definitely go for the OnePlus Buds Pro 2. The bass is a lot more present and deeper on the OnePlus Buds Pro 2. The highs are a little crispier on the Galaxy Buds2 Pro though. Since you use a Samsung phone you will also get a better codec (Samsung Seamless Codec) and spatial audio with the Galaxy Buds2 Pro. The OnePlus Buds Pro 2 have the LHDC codec, which isn't support by Samsung Galaxy devices and spatial audio is exclusive to OnePlus devices.

ANC is very similar on both, good but not amazing. The Sony WF-1000XM4 and the Devialet Gemini are better when it comes to ANC. Haven't tested the Bose QC Earbuds II yet, but from what I've read they should also beat the Samsung and OnePlus buds.

I've only had the OnePlus Buds Pro 2 for a few days, but so far the battery life seems a little better than the Galaxy Buds2 Pro. Around 5hrs with ANC active for the Galaxy Buds2 Pro and around 6hrs for the OnePlus Buds Pro 2. Without ANC you can expect both earbuds to last approximately 3hrs longer than with ANC enabled.

Both cases are feel premium and feature wireless charging. The case of the Galaxy Buds2 Pro is a little smaller but both are small enough to carry them in your pockets.

Both have an easy to use app, with all the features you need. The OnePlus Buds Pro 2 feature a fully customizable equalizer and golden sound, which is a combination of an ear channel scan and a hear test and it then automatically adjusts the sound to your individual ears. The Galaxy Buds2 Pro have 6 equalizer presets. A feature only found on the Galaxy Buds2 Pro is speak to chat, where transparency modes gets activated when you start to speak and deactivated again when you stop speaking. Only the OnePlus Buds Pro 2 will stop the music when you take one bud out of your ear.

Connection is effortless with both. Haven't experienced any dropouts in the connection with either of the buds. The OnePlus Buds2 Pro feature Google FastPair and Galaxy Buds2 Pro have Samsung's proprietary standard. One advantage that only the OnePlus Buds Pro 2 have is that they have Bluetooth multipoint, so you can be connected to two devices at the same time.

Can't comment on call quality, since I almost never do phone calls with my earbuds.

Personally, I would go with the OnePlus Buds2 Pro if you prefer a fun sound signature with lots of bass and want to use them across different devices. Go with the Galaxy Buds2 Pro if you want a more neutral sound and you primarily use them with Galaxy devices. Both are great earbuds and you can't really go wrong with either of them.",Jamin1337,5.0

Might come down to just which design you prefer. My biggest issue with Galaxy buds is if I need to maneuver them for comfort in my ear they always accidentally toggle the controls.

I wear them with transparency quite a bit - and they're so small, light, and nicely fit, that I have forgotten they were in more than a few times.  Like, *open my case to put them in my ears*, type of forgot.

I use aftermarket soft foams, which I do for most of my buds - but this time it's almost required.  The included silicone is quite comfy, but it's delicately thin, and I actually tore one just fit-checking them.  I wouldn't expect those to last forever.

The features are neat - and they come with everything you need - software wise - and they sound good... BUT.  They sound excellent with wavelet's Auto EQ settings for them.  I'm more of a v-shaped guy, and I dropped 500 to about 1.6k down a tiny bit, and they sound beautiful.  Out of the box, they're very neutral, which sounds unenthusiastic to most people - you can try to correct it with Samsung's EQ, but it's a halfway solution.  The bass is present and adequate out of the box; I'd call it accurate, rather than excited - which I also bump up a tiny bit in wavelet, and then it suits my taste, and they handle it just fine.

The battery life isn't stellar from what I hear, but I've never even brought them to low battery warning, so not an issue for me.  I also don't care about the 24bit seamless codec, I use Tidal premium and I cannot tell when it switches.

They're not the perfect TWS bud - but I choose them every single time because of the comfort.  Unparalleled in that department IMO.",bnonymousbeeeee,2.0

I've used a variety of buds before and hated them, constantly going back to wired headphones. But these are the first buds that work flawlessly (with the OnePlus 11, not sure what the experience is like on other phones). 
1. The build quality is superb, and looks really nice. Including the case! I have the green one.
2. I really love how easy the buds connect to the phone when taking it out the case or out the ear. And how fast it connects with no lag.
3. The Dolby Atmos makes a huge difference in sound quality. And the bass is decent for buds.
4. The spatial audio sounds weird to me so I turned it off, but I think it's because I'm using Spotify which doesn't support spatial yet, so I need to test it with Apple Music or alternatives that actually support it to see how it really sounds on these buds.
5. I love the noise cancellation and how it includes offline Zen Mode so you can go in zen mode even when away from your phone, and switch between calming sounds.
6. I wish there was an option to increase/decrease volume. Maybe there is a way, but I haven't looked yet.
7. I need to do more testing on the mic quality. Sometimes people hear me perfectly fine when in a noisy place, but sometimes they can't hear me at all and the background noise is amplified. So I'm trying to figure out if it's happening in specific apps or situations or specific people. I'm not sure yet.",thaman05,4.0

The buds 3 have a few less features than the pro 2 (no wireless charging, smaller main speaker, case is not ip5x). I think oneplus is figuring out the sweetspot for these buds. I think if they can keep it between $99 and $129 while adding some more features  it'll be a very good contender in this space.

The pro 2s have also retained their battery life well in the year I've owned them. I had the original pros and after a year their battery life was cut in half so I had to upgrade to the pro 2s. If your battery life is still good then you shouldn't have a reason to upgrade yet.",ostbn,7.0

I don't really a notice a difference between codecs though Samsung has a proprietary one with a higher bitrate. Unless you're an audiophile running a DAC and being extremely picky, you likely won't notice either. 

Waterproofing and dust resistance has been put to the test and they haven't had an issue. 

I do find the battery life isn't ideal if you run ANC but that's kind of a given it seems. 

I use the Wearables app and the Buds controller. Works just fine besides head tracking which Samsung locks because they're dicks. Kinda unnecessary anyways.
