But you need to turn off some other functionality in order to get this to work.

So, I want to be able to play/pause, turn ANC on and off, AND be able to adjust the volume. Unfortunately I can't do that. I need to switch one fo the earbuds to control volume. Then I would lose either play/pause or ANC on and off.

The AirPods Pro let me click the stem to play/pause, long click to turn ANC on and off, and swipe up and down on the stem to adjust volume.

The swiping for volume is a new feature added to the AirPods Pro 2.

And an NRR rating is a rating continuous passive noise isolation. So, if your sound isolation device has an NRR rating of say 25, then it needs to provide 25 decibles of sound dampening when you wear them under all conditions.

With ANC, when you're only cancelling out loud noises when there is a loud noise, then you're not going to get an NRR rating. Though if your ANC device has passive noise cancellation through the use of foam tips or other passive devices, that should get an NRR rating.

And NRR rating is also a guarantee. ANC uses math to figure out what frequencies to cancel. They can't guarantee that you'll always get the same NRR rated reduction every time you use them,

if you REALLY need sound protection, I would not recommend you get ANC headphones/earbuds. Get the right tool for the job.

But if you want sound protection as an added feature in case you're walking about and something causes a very loud noise, such as walking buy a construction worker using a jack hammer, then using ANC for those 10-20 seconds as you walk past them is probably better than not having any hearing protection at all.

But I agree with you that using them instead of actual hearing protection on a regular basis is not a good idea.",plazman30,7

Soundproofing is always better than ANC. You are also moving the goal posts and/or trying to justify your position. You specifically mentioned lawnmower duty. That is an occupational and continuous noise. It’s not a jack hammer, passing train or loud car that lasts 10-15sec. ANC is neither approved nor recommended for occupational noise hazards as it doesn’t offer significant protection.",Capid1,1

Not only does the ANC on Airpods Pro muffle noise regardless of whether \*loud\* noise is present, it also has a transparency mode that will reduce the volume of \*sudden\* loud noises down to a manageable level, made possible by the new chip that is polling for such noises at 48000x per second. (The old APP polled much much slower and thus were not capable of effectively acting as simple ear protection.)",frope,1

But I mow the lawn once a week or once every 2 weeks. If I owned a landscaping business, there is no way i would use ANC as my noise protection.

I used to work in a lab and we wore ear protection in the dog rooms, because 16-24 barking dogs make a LOT of noise in an enclosed space. When you're doing that on a daily basis, ANC is not the answer.

You are right. I moved the goal posts, but I think I misunderstood what you were saying. Apple, in their literature, talks about the APP being able to filter out sudden loud noises that happen around you when you have them in. I think that might help protect your hearing to a small degree.

But I would never consider using ANC as a method of sound protection for a day in and day out job.

I bought a pair of Sennheiser HD280 Pro Headphones last year. They're studio monitor headphones used for mixing. They 're not NRR rated, but Sennheiser claims they offer 25 dB of sound isolation. I've used those to mow the lawn and they're pretty good. 

So, IMHO, ANC is OK for blocking occasional loud noises while you're out and about. But if you need daily sound isolation, get proper ear protection. Otherwise you'll be sorry as you get older.",plazman30,5

Alas, they arrived today and everything seems legit. In anticipation for it being fake, I've watched all of the real vs fake videos online. By all accounts, it adds up to being the real deal. Here are all the factors that I considered:  
  
1. They sound good. They have an identical sound profile as the pair I bought for my wife for her bday directly from an authorized dealer.  
2. I was able to register the serial number on the website. The serial number on the box matches the case (but the ear pieces have different serial numbers). These are all the same for my wife's pair.  
3. The packaging matches exactly that of my wife's pair. The fonts are the same, same material for the security pull tab, same plastic wrapper on the case, same hard cardboard cradle, same eartips packaging, etc. Everything is the same.  
4. Spatial audio works and I was able to scan my head.  
5. The noise cancellation and transparency modes are identical to my wife's pair (evidently these are dead giveaways, as fakes are not good).  
6. The find my AirPod function and beep function work (another giveaway of fake if these functions don't work).

The speaker blew out after only a short time. They let me send them back and they sent me another one and this one works great. So like with a lot of refurbished things I know it’s not always guaranteed they work which is why I check to see about any warranties where buy those type of products. I’m glad they actually replaced them for me without jumping through hoops.,Floridamommy323,1

I advise all newcomers to read through all the comments. Very mixed bag. I was scammed and so were a few others. Red flags include a failure to respond to emails post purchase. Folks have brought their items to Apple and have confirmed these are high quality fakes. I'd suggest trying to get official confirmation prior to the refund window expiring, even then there's a risk as you'll read of the merchant not honoring or ghosting you over the refund. At best, you get lucky with a legitimate pair from their liquidated inventory from whoknowswhere. At medium, you'll have to play the warranty game to keep getting refurbs if yours don't work or update or get Apple support...but this warranty/game will last 1 year per their terms on the website (no, you won't be able to get AppleCare on these unless you're very lucky with the Apple Genius who will authorize it?).

All I can say is, diminishing returns hit pretty hard after a certain point. But just going by the pro 2’s to something like the hd800s is huge. Resolution takes a very solid uplift, so does imaging and instrument separation. Pro 2’s imaging is actually pretty great for what they are. It’s going to come down to what you crave in a high end headphone, but at the end of the day, the difference isn’t as massive as reviewers and audiophiles claim. Pro 2’s just so happen to sound natural, have great resolution for TWS, and performance for the price.

For reference I own 150+ IEMs and I have been in this for 10+ years. I've also been an Apple customer for a 15+ years until a few years ago when I stopped using their products since I do not seem to fall into their target demographics anymore.

This may surprise you but most non-dedicated companies generally apply the Minimum Viable Product approach and never invest more than it's needed as a base into anything. Especially Apple which is known to never put in more effort or money than it's required in any of their products, especially since Cook took over.

That being said, I never said the APP2 are bad, they are just good, they are nothing special, they are made to appeal to the largest audience possible and cost as little as possible while generating as much profit as possible. They're ok, not great.

Market cap, engineering talent, etc I do not believe matter as much as it's obvious everything Apple and the big players are doing is driven by $$$$$$$$$",LightBroom,0

I recently moved to the city and the car noise when walking to work was unbearable compared to the small town vibe I'm used to hearing. ANC doesn't eliminate the car noise entirely (that would be sorcery), but it makes it so so so much quieter and bearable.

These are the best tuned and detailed IEMs I own. I'm shocked. I've owned a handful of IEMs and headphones, but these take the cake in terms of sound quality and certainly in terms of features. I haven't reached mid-fi hell or and certainly not summit-fi, but these airpods break the boundary, to me, of the usual trade-off that wireless IEMs have against the products marketed toward audiophiles. These are my mid-fi tier. Previously, the trade-off was sound quality in favour of convenience, but for the gen 2 ApP this trade off is nowhere near as big or as apparent. I've used these every day since I got them for music/podcasts/audiobooks on my walk to and from work and for video and voice calls at home.

Wan'er much more exciting to listen to. AirPod Pro 2 jack of all master of none, not really that exciting to listen to.

For me the Wan'er's just feel more exciting. The mids are comparable, Wan'er has a bit more bass, but where the Wan'er really shines is the highs. Oh my god the highs on the Wan'er are amazing. Think songs like Nier OST or IU, where highs truly shine. I listened to IU's My Sea on both the AirPod Pro 2 and Wan'er and with the APP2 I got so bored of the sound signature 15 seconds into the song. With the Wan'er I felt a buzz of excitement the moment the song started and I ended up listening to the whole song enjoying it thoroughly.

I also listened to Brown Eyed Women off of Grateful Dead's Cornell 77. In the Wan'er the song was so lively and bright. On the APP2 it felt dead and boring.

If I had to describe it - Wan'er felt like the violin strings of the highs are vibrating, while the APP2 merely just outputs those highs like they were another sound. Songs on the Wan'er really pop and shine, whereas songs on the APP2 just felt you were listening on a regular car stereo but cleaner, that's it.

Also I did mess around with the ""EQ"" on the APP2. I set Vocals to Slight boost, and it felt like it was still muddy. Vocals to Moderate made it completely unlistenable. Bright on Slight was unlistenable. Wan'er would sit squarely between Vocals Slight<->Moderate BUT the Wan'er manages to achieve this cleanly and naturally sounding.

Song Update: Listened to Nier OST - Grandma (Destruction) fully on the Wan'er. Then immediately went back on the APP2 with the same song and immediately I noticed a veil covering every sound in the song. Like something was missing in all bass/mids/highs. It never felt more apparent as when you listen to a song fully on the Wan'er then switch onto the APP2.

*Disclaimer because someone's gonna make this comment. Obviously they are in different price brackets. Obviously the convenience of APP2 vastly outtrump that of the Wan'er, but that's an unfair comparison regardless and not the scope of this comparison.

I really wish Apple would give the user more granular control over EQ, but the best they manage is some alternate preset tunings and a slider to make things sound more high contrast buried under accessibility settings.

If you haven't done so already, on your iPhone go to Settings > Accessibility > Audio & Visual > Headphone Accommodations, and turn that toggle on. There are three preset tunings to choose from and a slider that makes things sound more crisp and contrasty.

The balanced tuning keeps the stock tuning mostly the same though perhaps boosts the bass and the upper mids slightly and clears out some of the veil. The vocal tuning tries to put more emphasis on the upper mids to emphasize vocals as the naming implies, though imo it makes music sound kind of weird and hollow most of the time (YMMV). The brightness tuning from what I can tell keeps the bass and mids mostly the same and seems to be a boost isolated to the lower/mid treble to give more of a perception of detail, though it may introduce some sibilance.

I feel like the balanced tuning with the boost slider on ""slight"" or ""moderate"", or the brightness tuning with the slider on ""slight"" make the APP2 sound a decent bit more open and exciting relative to the stock tuning, though feel free to play around with it. I find putting the slider on the strong setting in any tuning mode makes things sound a little too crispy and artificially boosted.

Now there is of course a intentional difference to wired lossless, its compression after all, and while that should be indescernible to almost everyone at the 256kbps bitrate apple uses, if you have very golden ears perhaps you can hear the difference. I wouldn't consider that difference ""laughable"" though.

I personally have not tried the performer 5's but I felt the pro 2's compare very favorably to iems in its price bracket and that they sound quite good relative to the s12/blessing/ie200/etc. IMO out of those few only the s12's really came close.

Of course, it's all preference, and perhaps you have absolutely golden ears, but to say the drivers aren't even close is a bit much, they are a very capable pair even for the price. That and I highly recommend setting up a proper ABX test between lossy AAC256 and a flac (or even mp3 320 and a flac) and seeing if you can tell the difference.

Keep in mind this is specifically for the pro 2's, the first generation pros have awful tuning and the ""regular"" AirPods suffer from their open-type design. I'm not saying they're the greatest earbuds to ever grace the earth, far from it, the tuning is quite boring apart from that signature sub-bass boost and a large part of their appeal is the DSP tricks apple plays (branded as spatial audio), but they sound good enough for me to permanently replace my iems for daily use whereas my previous TWS pairs were limited to the gym and not much else.

(I've also momentarily tried the AirPods with their vision pro headset, which is capable of lossless audio and while the latency was nonexistent the sound between lossy and lossless was identical.

That's a huge difference. 

Earbuds aren't meant just for music. They often accommodate other tasks that limit their full potential for sound.

The Andromeda is the cheapest IEM you'll find that gives you an out of head sound field. To get comfortable and wear all day with an out of your head soundstage, you need to go CIEM, with the Supermoon ($1500 USD) or the Bonneville ($1900 USD). That is the true wear forever, feel like they are floating in your ears and never get uncomfortable because they perfectly for your ear canals! But they also attenuate sound by *a lot!* 

The Andromeda with Symbio or Comply tips is also pretty good for wearing a long time. Its all about the tips you use!

I don't know why you think its a big deal to have this ""transparency mode,"" really I think the best thing about IEMs is *not* hearing the crap going on around you. Why does it matter to hear when someone is coming up behind you? What's going to happen, and really, if something were to happen, what would you do that hearing that person would change the situation? For having a conversion, you just *take one out of your ear and put it back in after!* Especially if you get one of the above, even in Universal, which makes them $400 cheaper, then there is a *massive* gulf between them and the Buds2 Pro, for sure! The Supermoon or Bonneville is quite a far ways above the Andromeda, even in Universal, let along CIEM! 

Having a great DAC/amp makes a huge difference too. You'll never find a Gold Bar, they only made 1000 and I was very lucky to grab one. But you can get a Luxury and Precision W4, that is pretty well just as good!

The difference in sound quality is in the single digit percentages, and most of the enjoyability comes from sound signature preferences. My favorite IEMs are the Sennheiser IE 900, 64 Audio Nio, Sony IER-Z1R, Empire Ears Legend Evo, and Empire Ears Odin. The Andromeda doesn't do it for me, because I just simply don't care for the sound signature. It doesn't hit the sub bass level that I prefer. Again, that's all subjective. They are great IEMs in their own right. The Galaxy Buds2 Pro are tuned just about perfectly for my sound signature preferences. It's unreal how good they are, when you consider they are $115, are small and comfortable, are an all-in-one DAC/amp/IEM/microphone/pass-through/ANC/case/charger combo, and are so insanely convenient to use. I have a FiiO Q5S, which is a more than capable DAC/amp. It's just too bulky to bring around. I also have a KHADAS Tea, which gets much more use, because it's so much more convenient. Still, I almost never use my IEMs. I'm telling you that there is no massive gulf between any IEM and the Galaxy Buds2 Pro. It's so small that it's not worth the extra cost and inconvenience. I'm a massive speaker/headphone person, and I just don't see the need for IEMs outside of performances or motorcycle riding anymore. Not having cables tied to anything is also a massive benefit. It feels so free to be able to move around without worrying about them being pulled out of your ears or getting tangled.

I'll try to explain the benefits of having transparency mode and ANC one more time. If you still don't understand, I'm not sure I can help you.

Transparency Mode: When sitting in an office setting with bosses, team members, and underlings around, blocking outside audio is unacceptable. It looks bad to management when they call your name and you can't hear. It looks bad having IEMs and cables coming out of your ears. Early in my career, I was told not to wear headphones in the office at all, and they thought I was just goofing around because of it. If I'm not listening to conversations going on in my office, I may miss critical issues I could be solving. When at the office, I don't have to remove anything from my ears. I just pause the music and listen. I can carry a full conversation without having to remove my Buds. If I'm not listening to the door, I could miss deliveries, office visits, people I could help, or my owner coming around the corner to see me on Reddit at work. If I'm blocking outside sounds while walking home from the train station at night, I could be completely oblivious to the crackhead walking up quickly behind me to jump me. I've avoided many dangerous situations just by being aware of my surroundings, and hearing is the first notification of danger. 

ANC: If I'm in a safe space and there is background noise I don't want to hear, having the ability to turn on ANC is incredible. Flipping from transparency mode to listen to the pilot, to ANC once we take off, is amazing. The entire world just seems to turn off. None of my IEMs provide anywhere close to the level of isolation as ANC buds. Of course CIEMs will do that, but I'm not even sure they would be as good at eliminating the constant low frequency hum of equipment or planes.

And again, they are $115. You can't even get a DAC/amp for that much, let alone IEMs that would make an appreciable difference.",Dasbeerboots,3

Never saw it that way before... I also never have been in that kind of situation before. Thanks for taking the time to explain, I always appreciated other perspectives! I'm not sure that a CIEM would eliminate the very low frequency him from say, a plane engine... They may, because of the excellent blocking once you have music in they might just drown it out. I've noticed that on planes, but having dedicated ANC would be better...

I had no idea that the Buds Pro are that amazing... Google must be taking a loss somewhere to put them out at that price, or they rely on sheer volume of sales to make up cost in development and research it takes to make a high sound quality product like that... I never heard anyone else say they are that great, but if they are a very good match for the DAC/amp inside of them... they could of course be quite good as the hardware would have some synergy. Just hard for me to believe that they are actually that great!

I might need to pick up a pair, and try them out! I bet they are in Amazon, so that's a low risk way to try them. If they are that good, I'd have to add them to my collection, since the transparency mode does sound very useful... I can totally see that now!

You are wrong in the sense that audio is subjective and people won't automatically like something just because it's wired and ""audiophile"" nor does that necessarily mean it's objectively better. There are plenty of audiophile grade headphones that have a very disliked tuning that many/most people don't like (example: Beyerdynamic DT990, Grados)

The Airpod Pro 2 tuning is honestly much more fun and engaging out of the box that just about any audiophile headphone I've owned or tried. Do they have as much detail? No. Do they sound as open? No. Do they have as good of imaging? Not really. Are they fun and pleasant to listen to. Absolutely yes.

Even though I found the bass on the APP2 a bit too ""boomy"" and slightly bloated for my tastes they are easily one of the best *tuned* headphones out of the box that I've tried. I EQ all my headphones but if I had to take one pair totally stock for daily use it might be the APP2. They're just fun and engaging to listen to.

Also...

>a trillion features and gimmicks

* ease of use: instant connectivity with iPhones, almost no dropouts, don’t need to deal with cables. Small form for both earbuds and case. Built in find my capabilities which works very well (I misplace my earbuds or case a lot). MagSafe makes it an ease to charge (using MagSafe charger). 

* battery life: I go days without having to charge anything. Connect to fast charger and both buds and case charge up fast if needed. Otherwise MagSafe charger is great and easy. 

* comfort: probably one of the most comfortable earbud I’ve ever worn. Lightweight, fits in ear easily and no extra weight from cable.

But that’s VASTLY missing the point of what AirPods are for. 

I would explain how massively useful they are and I say this with great confidence, I cannot live without a pair of AirPods. Not because they sound amazing (even though the sound quality is pretty darn decent, better than any consumer grade headphones I’ve tried or any other TWS IEM I’ve tried) but because of the “gimmicks”. If they are gimmicks to you, then why are you even considering them? If you don’t care about wireless or noise cancellation or anything like that, then why honestly even waste your time? 

Also to answer your question, IE200’s seem hit or miss. IE300’s have shit tier build quality, IE600s I cannot attest to since I’ve never owned them, but IE900s are decent. For $200, there are definitely better options than IE200. Just my opinion btw.

Back to AirPods, I have no idea who “he” is in this context, but even for audiophiles, convenience matters. Fruit for thought, but I think if you’re ultimately uninterested in TWS, then you won’t find one that you like solely based on sound quality, because you won’t find one that comes close to anything like a kiwi ears quartet for instance. The price of AirPods doesn’t reflect the sound quality, because it’s more than just sound quality. Sounds like you should change your research strategy.",MoonWun_,1

Convenience factor however is insane. The ""it just works"" factor cannot be overstated enough. This is the one part of the APP2 that should be romanticized imo.

With APP2's \*too good\* noise cancelling I felt like I was totally alone and it weirds me the fuck out.

[I tried measuring them](https://precog.squig.link/?share=Apple_Airpods_Pro_Gen_2), but take the squigs with a grain of salt because of the DSP that Apple applies when they’re in the ear. For example, sometimes I’ve noticed that the sub-bass quantity on my OG tapers off after a few seconds of having them inserted. [They also compensate depending on the loudness you're listening at.](https://precog.squig.link/?share=Apple_Airpods_Pro_Gen_2_70dB,Apple_Airpods_Pro_Gen_2_80dB,Apple_Airpods_Pro_Gen_2_90dB) Basically, both are very difficult to measure accurately. But down to the differences I hear in actual listening:

* The bass on the Gen 2 is noticeably more sub-bass focused than the OG, and with *significantly* more SPL than measurements might suggest. It’s not great intangibly - it still lacks texture and there’s a good amount of bass blurriness. But it’s pretty fun anyways and can certainly go brrr where the OG can't.
* Midrange on the Gen 2 is more forward from 1-3kHz. Perceptively, this gives vocals more bite compared to the OG. I wouldn’t say it’s quite in shouty territory; maybe on the cusp of being strident on certain tracks in tandem with the more exaggerated treble.
* Gen 2 has more mid-treble at around 8kHz, as well as slightly more upper-treble. This adds some upper-harmonics back to female vocals which the OG lacked. Again, these differences beget a greater sense of clarity to the Gen 2 but it’s not quite as smooth a listen.
* Treble on the Gen 2 still sounds dipped somewhere after 8kHz, in the mid-treble. I think this characteristic is partially what gives both the Gen 2 and OG uncharacteristically plasticky timbre for DDs. I wouldn’t be surprised if it affects the sense of bass texture as well.

Basically what you have here is a more exciting, technical version of the OG Airpods. It sounds less tame - more *dynamic* \- and the execution is pretty solid for the most part. But it's also not completely inoffensive anymore. I’ll keep them just because the new features and ANC are pretty good, and my OG Airpods are on their way out lol. It basically sounds the same on all three modes if anyone was wondering btw. Maybe like 1-2dB less 1-3kHz with transparency vs. ANC on. But that might just be psychoacoustic (eg. ANC blocks out ambient noise which, in turn, makes the upper-midrange sound more forward).",Precogvision,262

I work in a noisey lab (fans, vibrating equipment, etc) where we're allowed to have headphones in all day, but they can't be super isolating due to safety procedures and people coming up and asking you questions, so the transparency mode coupled with ANC seems like the perfect combination. 

But I'm holding off buying these because I DESPISE the fact that these are considered ""disposable"" tech by Apple themselves and have a lifespan of something like 3-4 years before you're literally just supposed to throw them away. 

The only other option would be to keep using my Etymotic IEMs in one ear, which is driving me crazy. Wanted to give these a shot but really am not fond of a $250 pair of IEMs having a shelf life beyond my control.",Peridotitic,19

Hey Precog, really appreciate your insight and data on these. Could you help me understand something? I’m wondering, why is there such a noticeable difference between your measurements and Crinacle’s, I mean aside from DSP? I’m using the IEF Neutral target. Both of the graphs are normalized for 1khz at 60db by default. However, I notice for your graph, I have to go to the top area and re-enter 1000hz. And then that’s when the AirPods measurement will raise and line up with 60db at 1khz, same for the 1st AirPods Pro (a bug?). And so all below 1k is a big hill going up towards bass. It appears excessively bassy or muddy.

I double checked with Crinacle’s graph and went to the top to re-type 1000hz in the normalization settings. It is already lined up as expected. I realize digital signal processing is throwing a big variable into all of this but none of your measurements are similar to Crinacle’s. It just seems on your graph these are noticeably more V shaped, bassy, and bleeds into the mids. Then on Crinacle’s measurements they appear much more tame, balanced with less treble.

I figured this is just a confusing time that will clear up once this is all figured out but what doesn’t make sense is that I see the same general differences for your original AirPods Pro vs Crinacle’s measurement. Then looked further into this and I notice the same thing vs RTINGS measurements (1st AirPods Pro). One step further, I notice SuperReview’s graphing tool lines up more with your measurements (1st AirPods Pro). With his tool you have to change normalization from 500hz to 1000hz. Is this all just the difference in measurement rigs? If so, why wouldn’t it apply to measurements from Sony’s XM4 earbuds or XBA-N3, for example? Those are much more similar across the board. Thank you so much for any clarification. Here are the other graphs:

edifier stax spirit s3,headphones,Edifier Stax Spirit S3 Review,vhc4q9,the_bad_fish_2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/vhc4q9,104,46,1655816556,"Here are my initial thoughts/review of the Audeze LCD-1 wireless, aka Stax S3.

Unboxing - I hate unboxing. Boxes are for shoe collectors. Look at Beats. What good is a good box if the product is junk? The box to this is covered in Stax branding, which is odd because of topics I will touch on later. Inside the box was another box with another box and a sleeve with the headphone case and the headphones. Too much packaging. I care about the environment. There is so much waste in this useless packaging. Want to impress me? Make a good product.

Travel Case - My legal team is telling me I can't call it the same case as the Audeze LCD-1 with a Stax logo. I posted pictures. You decide. It is a nice hard case with minimal branding. The inside has a non-expanding mesh with a small (1 in) Velcro strip to hold it shut. There is a felt center divider to keep the ear cups separate, which is terrible. It feels low quality and doesn't serve a purpose. Overall 8/10.

Build - Do you have Audeze LCD-1? That is how they feel. The headband is the same. The pads are the same. It does come with earpads that match the case look but are probably the softest earpads. They are really comfortable. The pads are the same 4 plastic clip design as the LCD-1. Easy to change out. Mostly, the build is plastic with a metal adjustment band inside the plastic. Not bad. There is a 3.5 mm jack on one side for when the electronics eventually die. Above average build. 7/10

Comfort - These are heavier than the LCD-1. This is to include the wireless bits and the batteries. I used them for 4 hours straight without any discomfort. I was using the soft pads and not the leather pads. I didn't get the headband pain and clamping force was solid without being too tight. It is closed back so they could get hot with the leather pads. Since I haven't tested this, I won't comment more on it. 9/10

Wireless Features - I didn't know what to call this. This is why you would pick a wireless headphone over wired. This has an 80 hour battery life, which is impressive. I think the standard is closer to 20 hours on overear. My Sony XM4 is close to that. I have the Grado GW100v2 that are 20-ish. Unlike the XM4, there is no noise cancelling. There is a lot of leak, especially at high volumes. It has three buttons, which control everything. No touch controls are present. The buttons do a lot, but it is so much I'll probably never use it. The start up voice is the standard trash voice that non-descriptive BLE headphones have. When not playing music, there is a hiss. It is noticeable. It uses Aptx-HD, which isn't LDAC quality but is better than average for bit rate. Overall, the features are a let down. 2/10

Sound Quality - They sound okay. Better than most BLE headphones, but that is a low bar to clear. I know that I'm not legally allowed to say they are closed back wireless LCD-1, even though I did say that at the beginning. These do not sound as good as the LCD-1. They sound alright. In the audiophile world, I give them a solid ""meh"" out of 10. They will do. Desert island headphones. I like the LCD-1. I am an Audeze fanboy though. My gaming headphones are the LCD-GX. Good headphones. The LCD-1 are great for their price. These don't sound like closed back LCD-1. They do sound like planars. The bass goes low without being boomy. They are fast. They just aren't amazing, which they should be for the price. They sound average for wireless and below average for audiophile headphones. I stick with before. Meh/10

Oddities - Now that everything else is out of the way, I wanted to cover the strangeness of these headphones. Why do they look identical to the LCD-1? Was this to save on cost? If so, why are they $399? These are not $399 headphones. These are $250 headphones. At $399, you are above the big wireless hitters. Sony and Bose make better headphones, as far as wireless features, than this. Why does the case say Stax but the headphone say Edifier. Who is Edifier? I know someone will comment with the detailed history of Edifier and call me a know-nothing for not knowing who they are. I have never heard of them before these. Why call them Stax if you aren't branding the actual product as Stax? 

Overall, these miss the mark. There are so many other wireless headphones you can get for the price. I'm comparing them as wireless because that is what they are. I purchased these to be a competitor to my XM4. I'm leaving to CT next week. On the plane, I was going to take these. I'll probably take my XM4. These are not Stax. These are not Audeze. These are Edifier. Above average wireless headphones priced too high. For $399, you could get the XM4 on sale for $350, a Wendy's spicy chicken sandwich, and gas. If these were $250, I would say pick them up.

This is my first audio review. It is a little rant-y but that is what I'm like. Thanks for reading.",the_bad_fish_2,33

Almost comes across as a parody of Stax (I haven't heard a ""proper"" Stax, but from my imagination- bright and bassless).

On the default profile though, these are very well tuned.

Actually quite similar to the AKG N700NCM2 BUT with the bass reined in so it's not boomy, and more detail. Very close to Harman. Better tuned than the N700, which was itself well tuned. The bass is very good, it's there, there is a Harman-level shelf, with a little more mid-bass (I can take that), but *not too much*, and it extends really well into the sub-bass as well.

https://vsg.squig.link/?share=Harman_Combined_Over-Ear_Target,Edifier_STAX_SPIRIT_S3_Lambskin_BT,Edifier_STAX_SPIRIT_S3_Mesh_BT,Sennheiser_x_Drop_HD_6XX

On initial listen, with some tracks I get a bit of sharpness in the treble. Many tracks there is none at all, it's very content dependent. I may get used to that. And the soundstage is pretty flat. While they are detailed there is a certain flatness to the way they sound. I have the Edition XS and the HD600 as well- the Edition XS sound a lot better. The HD600 sounds better too. 

I haven't heard the Sony XM4, but I suspect these sound a lot better than the Sony XM4. I can't imagine I could deal with the bass on the XM4. For me they are better than the N700 and a lot of that is the bass is better controlled.

They aren't very isolating at all though. Like they are a closed back, so they are much more isolating than an open back, but for a closed back, the isolation is pretty weak. I'm using the mesh/cooling gel pads which are much more comfortable than the leather ones. With these it's actually very comfortable. Dimension and fit wise, it's very similar to the N700. Fit is solid and secure, but there can be a bit of a creak with head/jaw movement, particularly if you wear glasses. This isn't at the level it's disqualifying, I get creak on the Edition XS as well. But it's definitely there.

Overall, I think they are compelling if you want a very well tuned Harman neutral wireless closed back, and want that one thing, and don't care about anything else, because they don't do anything else. I also paid Asian pricing for them, so closer to $200 than $400. I'd be less ecstatic at $400. But I can't imagine being happy with the likes of the XM4/XM5 or the Airpods Max at that price level either.",blorg,2

Audeze assure me that it's okay, and nothing to worry about. This is an copypaste from their site. 


""Since air is trapped between your head and the diaphragm it creates a pressure zone, and as the headphones shift with movement you may hear a slight crinkling sound from the diaphragm. This is a normal occurrence with planar magnetic drivers and is nothing to be concerned about, it's the sound of the thin diaphragm moving back and forth with the changes in air pressure.

Sometimes as the driver film stretches slightly with age, the sound can become more apparent, and sometimes it may also lessen again. This is mostly influenced by factors in your environment (such as temperature and humidity), and we don't have much control over whether or not this occurs.

One important note is that we strongly recommend exercising certain cautions when handling planar magnetic headphones: trapped air can create high pressure and sudden pressure changes could damage the diaphragms, and this is not covered by warranty. The same is true when you put the headphones on or take them off-- it's not a good idea to press them hard and fast against the head, so we recommend slow and steady movement to allow the air pressure to stabilize.""",Getagraxx,1

really? I searched just now and there does seem to be a few Spirit S3 posts with a decent amount of upvotes.

>Any idea why Edifier hasn’t tried to improve it?

anyway regarding App updates. is anything broken in the App?? if everything is running fine I don't really see a need to push an app update. (if the app/firmware is already great it can often be the case that a minor app update actually breaks an existing function)

if custom EQ is what you want, well I guess if it wasn't technically advertised to begin with they have no real obligation to add that feature. you never know though sometimes companies are responsive to feedback. but yeah I wouldn't hold my breath if it has been 1.5 years since you requested it.

There's really not much STAX in here aside from the part where Edifier decided to make a new product line called STAX SPIRIT, and the new S3 is the debut entry. It's not an e-stat (sorry, ear speakers) headphones but rather uses custom Audeze planar magnetic drivers and draws heavy inspirations from most of the LCD-1 design, accessory, and even the case owing to Edifier (1) owning STAX fully and (2) being a significant shareholder in Audeze.

The products that are most similar to this would be the Drop Panda and Audeze LCD-1, Mobius and Penrose (although open back). AFAIK, those don't have a good reputation for having good sound. 

STAX has been (generally) received pretty well for most audiophiles; if you don't focus on the lack of bass and look at the sheer clarity, they are (objectively) good headphones. On the contrary, people are more divided on the objective sound for Audeze, let alone their wireless planars.

So I've actually tried the wired (non-BT) Anandas (mentioned above) and thought they were nice but not sooo perfect that I could settle for the inability to custom EQ it to some degree. (I am painfully picky). I can't imagine the BT sounds better than the wired Anandas but I would SERIOUSLY consider it if it came alongside an app where I could EQ (not sure they do though). Maybe I should seriously consider regardless...

Also, yep!: my hesitation is that you can't custom EQ wired headphones, and at least the bluetooth dac/amps I've seen have very limited sound changing ability (the one I tried in store could boost bass or boost soundstage but that's it). I feel like I'm just too picky and neurotic to go without custom EQ. Other than that but less important, I prefer for them to be handsfree for dancing especially, but even just for multitasking, when I can't be holding my phone or the dac/amp and I've got no pockets.

(I suppose I could probably get a less expensive wired pair, but walked away from the gear store with the impression of like - oh man, that's \*two\* expensive pieces of gear now. Cause the seller recommended wired Anandas + ifi goBLU and I think they were something like $750 combined which is a LOT)",ao2541,1

You really don't need to EQ on the headphone-manufacturer's bluetooth app directly. What's your source going to be? If using a phone or pc you can always install a separate app to handle EQ or use the EQ functionality of your music player. You might want to look into that.

On the topic of bluetooth dac/amps and having no pockets, something like the Qudelix 5K (does it's job well, is small and light and doesn't break the bank) just clips on and has very detailed EQ controls. That's the kind of solution I was suggesting if you're not happy with any of the BT models.",wavecult,1

When you do this it resets them. Next, if you paired them already choose ""forget this device"" in Bluetooth. Now take each earbud out the case and put them on. You should hear the tone in each ear showing they have powered on. Next tape each ear but 3 times at the same time. Once they pair you will hear a piano tone in each ear. When you hear this, turn on your Bluetooth on your phone and find the device and connect. If it doesn't not connect, choose :forget this device"" again.

I did this multiple times.

I had issues with the right ear bud

The left ear bud flashed red rapidly. After that white flash.

I had to let go of it after. And hold it again for 8 sec to get it flash red rapidly. After that. I took both out. With my Bluetooth on(iPhone). It told me to forget them. I did. And after I reconnected them. They both connected.

For the squeeze to play/pause time, is it nearly instantenous or is there a slight delay.?

For example, my previous set was the galaxy buds pro (1st gen) with an S10+, and when I tapped the bud to pause, it took about 0.1-0.2s. When I used my galaxy buds on my Oneplus 11, I measured a 1.2-1.7s delay before it paused the music. This and the lower music quality (since OP does not have samsungs scalable codec), made me want to upgrade. 

&#x200B;

The lack of volume control is annoying (hopefully you can recommend some solution, beyond manually pressing the buttons on the phone), and I hope these headphones can stay in my ear when I go for light runs and do stair runs like my galaxy buds pros.

to get them to sound at their potential you need a program called peace eq, and a PC

off a cellphone they will be as generic as any other earbud, but certainly not worse, 25$, they have 4.4 stars out of 5 which is pretty much as high as it gets, ive seen for 4.6 and 4.5's out there but its rare

if you heard the htc's first, you would refund the l4ncs they do NOT sound any better.

they also, sound as good as my beats studio buds.

If you like bass, definitely go for the OnePlus Buds Pro 2. The bass is a lot more present and deeper on the OnePlus Buds Pro 2. The highs are a little crispier on the Galaxy Buds2 Pro though. Since you use a Samsung phone you will also get a better codec (Samsung Seamless Codec) and spatial audio with the Galaxy Buds2 Pro. The OnePlus Buds Pro 2 have the LHDC codec, which isn't support by Samsung Galaxy devices and spatial audio is exclusive to OnePlus devices.

ANC is very similar on both, good but not amazing. The Sony WF-1000XM4 and the Devialet Gemini are better when it comes to ANC. Haven't tested the Bose QC Earbuds II yet, but from what I've read they should also beat the Samsung and OnePlus buds.

I've only had the OnePlus Buds Pro 2 for a few days, but so far the battery life seems a little better than the Galaxy Buds2 Pro. Around 5hrs with ANC active for the Galaxy Buds2 Pro and around 6hrs for the OnePlus Buds Pro 2. Without ANC you can expect both earbuds to last approximately 3hrs longer than with ANC enabled.

Both cases are feel premium and feature wireless charging. The case of the Galaxy Buds2 Pro is a little smaller but both are small enough to carry them in your pockets.

Both have an easy to use app, with all the features you need. The OnePlus Buds Pro 2 feature a fully customizable equalizer and golden sound, which is a combination of an ear channel scan and a hear test and it then automatically adjusts the sound to your individual ears. The Galaxy Buds2 Pro have 6 equalizer presets. A feature only found on the Galaxy Buds2 Pro is speak to chat, where transparency modes gets activated when you start to speak and deactivated again when you stop speaking. Only the OnePlus Buds Pro 2 will stop the music when you take one bud out of your ear.

Connection is effortless with both. Haven't experienced any dropouts in the connection with either of the buds. The OnePlus Buds2 Pro feature Google FastPair and Galaxy Buds2 Pro have Samsung's proprietary standard. One advantage that only the OnePlus Buds Pro 2 have is that they have Bluetooth multipoint, so you can be connected to two devices at the same time.

Can't comment on call quality, since I almost never do phone calls with my earbuds.

Personally, I would go with the OnePlus Buds2 Pro if you prefer a fun sound signature with lots of bass and want to use them across different devices. Go with the Galaxy Buds2 Pro if you want a more neutral sound and you primarily use them with Galaxy devices. Both are great earbuds and you can't really go wrong with either of them.",Jamin1337,5

I wear them with transparency quite a bit - and they're so small, light, and nicely fit, that I have forgotten they were in more than a few times.  Like, *open my case to put them in my ears*, type of forgot.

I use aftermarket soft foams, which I do for most of my buds - but this time it's almost required.  The included silicone is quite comfy, but it's delicately thin, and I actually tore one just fit-checking them.  I wouldn't expect those to last forever.

The features are neat - and they come with everything you need - software wise - and they sound good... BUT.  They sound excellent with wavelet's Auto EQ settings for them.  I'm more of a v-shaped guy, and I dropped 500 to about 1.6k down a tiny bit, and they sound beautiful.  Out of the box, they're very neutral, which sounds unenthusiastic to most people - you can try to correct it with Samsung's EQ, but it's a halfway solution.  The bass is present and adequate out of the box; I'd call it accurate, rather than excited - which I also bump up a tiny bit in wavelet, and then it suits my taste, and they handle it just fine.

The battery life isn't stellar from what I hear, but I've never even brought them to low battery warning, so not an issue for me.  I also don't care about the 24bit seamless codec, I use Tidal premium and I cannot tell when it switches.

They're not the perfect TWS bud - but I choose them every single time because of the comfort.  Unparalleled in that department IMO.",bnonymousbeeeee,2

I've used a variety of buds before and hated them, constantly going back to wired headphones. But these are the first buds that work flawlessly (with the OnePlus 11, not sure what the experience is like on other phones). 
1. The build quality is superb, and looks really nice. Including the case! I have the green one.
2. I really love how easy the buds connect to the phone when taking it out the case or out the ear. And how fast it connects with no lag.
3. The Dolby Atmos makes a huge difference in sound quality. And the bass is decent for buds.
4. The spatial audio sounds weird to me so I turned it off, but I think it's because I'm using Spotify which doesn't support spatial yet, so I need to test it with Apple Music or alternatives that actually support it to see how it really sounds on these buds.
5. I love the noise cancellation and how it includes offline Zen Mode so you can go in zen mode even when away from your phone, and switch between calming sounds.
6. I wish there was an option to increase/decrease volume. Maybe there is a way, but I haven't looked yet.
7. I need to do more testing on the mic quality. Sometimes people hear me perfectly fine when in a noisy place, but sometimes they can't hear me at all and the background noise is amplified. So I'm trying to figure out if it's happening in specific apps or situations or specific people. I'm not sure yet.",thaman05,4

Reviewers that make videos / write blogs for the general audience are probably going to weigh other factors more heavily than sound quality (e.g. ANC, battery life, bulkiness/form factor, software support, ecosystem & branding) while audio specific reviewers care more about the sound.

It's probably also worth mentioning that reviewers that cater to general audiences rate the sound of the gear subjectively and are less likely to look at the frequency response or other technical specifications, while (I think/hope) that audio specific reviewers use more objective methods.

These reviewers may also prefer overly bassy or V-shaped sounds (not that these are inherently bad), similar to what the general audience prefers. This is in contrast with audio-specific reviewers in in the hobby and *their* audiences who prefer a more balanced / transparent sound.

Just some guesses as to why there's a discrepancy.

To sum it up nicely, different types of reviewers and the audiences that follow them have different needs. Audio-specific people want to listen to things ""as the artist/sound engineer intended"" (or try to, anyway...), while the general audience just wants to have a good time on the bus/train/airplane.",ComplicatedMouse,47

That being said, a good TWS with strong active Noise Cancelling will probably allow better fidelity than a passive isolation IEM (where you still get all the vibrations from the outer ear). That's why TWS Active Noise Cancelling earphones are arguably unbeatable when it comes to fidelity (I say arguably because it's artificial, but still, you're cancelling up to 30dBs of noise with more accuracy than any passive barrier which is impossible to beat). Another thing to consider is that TWS earphones can be tuned to your hearing loss specs and to your ear canal with sonic resonance.  
Samsung Galaxy Buds a no-brainer option that's quite good and work seamlessly with Samsung phones that many already have.  
They're probably not as good raw, but Samsung has put a lot of R&D into making software tuning that achieves top notch results. I prefer brands that are not soft-locking features to galaxy phones, so I'd go with the Soundcore's A40s (noting that they had a faulty batch and you might have to ask for a warranty replacement, the customer support is quite good in my experience). The A40s have more flexibility in the software, allow dual device pairing, have really nice pre-made EQs, with the option for a flat curve.",zareliman,1

The MTW3 has [more mid-bass as well as more recessed upper mids](https://imgur.com/a/BF34yuF); the more recessed upper mids further accentuates the mid-bass bloat. 

I have both of these, to me the Buds2 Pro definitely sounds much cleaner and clearer out of the box while the MTW3 is a bit boomy and dark sounding, much less clear. It's not terrible though at all, and I could even take the bass as is if the upper mids were just a bit more forward, although my preference is just a little less.

I EQ the mid-bass down (-2dB) and the upper mids up (+5dB) on the TWS3, the new 5 band EQ actually has the bands right in the place you'd want them to correct this and after EQ the TWS3 sound great, I think possibly even better than the Buds2 Pro. Part of this might be the codec, the Buds2 Pro I'm using AAC on an Android (which is reputedly bad- Samsung phones have SSC which is a better codec) while the TWS3 is using AptX Adaptive (which sounds good to me on anything else I have).

Before EQ though, in their default out-of-the-box the Buds2 Pro are much better tuned. They are also very compact, have great intuitive touch controls that work and allow me to control everything (volume, stop/start, prev/next, ANC on/off, ambient on/off), ambient with a windshield so it still works even if you're moving, decent ANC.

Many more ""audiophile"" reviewers prefer a more restrained bass with sub-bass emphasis but with it coming down in the mid-bass so it doesn't bloat over the lower mids.

Harman's research also uses this sort of bass curve, where the bass emphasis is all in the sub-bass and with little mid-bass so it keeps a very ""clean"" sound.

Samsung owns Harman- hence why Samsung stuff is now also mostly tuned to the Harman curve. The Buds2 Pro are extremely close to the Harman curve.

Most headphone-specific reviewers are not fully on board with every detail of Harman IE, and I'm not either, but think it's in the right general direction. The Buds2 Pro in any case err slightly towards improving on Harman, most measurements they have slightly more mid-bass, slightly less upper mids and better treble extension than Harman, all of which are positives.

Some headphone-specific reviewers do feel the mid-bass cut on Harman is a bit *too* much, and prefer more of a glide down. Particularly for genres like rock music. And I can see that too, but the TWS3 are still just a little too much in the bass, stock. And there has been a bit of move away from this with other audiophile reviewers as well, Crinacle used be 100% Harman bass but his new ""diffuse field with a tilt  and a bass shelf"" curve, and newer collabs, after the bass shelf comes down it tends to slope down gently to 1kHz, while Harman goes in the other direction, it cuts very deeply and then slopes back up. And I think that is a bit much, and the *slightly* more mid-bass with the tilt down to 1kHz does sound more natural, if not quite as clean. But these are all splitting hairs in how much, they are mostly still much less than the the mid-bass of many consumer headphones.

But loads of bass has been the consumer staple for ever, I am old enough to remember Sony ""MEGA BASS"" in the late 80s, early 90s. I was total bass bass bass myself until relatively recently, it's only in the last 5 years or so when I started really getting into more ""audiophile"" Head-Fi I came to appreciate a more balanced sound. It's still there with some higher-end stuff, like look at the bass on the Beyerdynamic Xelento which is their TOTL IEM, it's nuts (although balanced by very present upper mids and then some spicy treble- it's not all bad). There is still a tendency even in the bassier audiophile stuff, like the Sony IER-Z1R, to prioritize sub-bass over mid-bass and to bring it down relatively quick to maintain ""clean"". And this is the thing, the Z1R is often considered one of the absolute end-game ""basshead"" TOTL IEMs. But it doesn't actually have *that much bass*,  it's only a lot of bass for something ""audiophile"". The MTW3 actually has more bass than the Z1R does- so this is where it comes down with ""consumer"" vs ""audiophile"".

It's what you're used to, as well. If you are used to tons of mid-bass bloat, that being gone will sound clinical, dry, tinny, lean, all of this. It's only when you sit down and use something with that signature, you'll get used to it and then go back to something bassy and it will sound just way too much. Listen to anything long enough and you'll adjust.",blorg,5

I was consistently getting *painful* sibilance issues *for months* and now it's just *gone* and I have been testing with control songs and many different tips. When did you do that first measurement and on what firmware? And what did you use to measure it? 

There are actually a lot more variables here because there is software in the buds themselves controlling the sound at least somewhat because of the ANC features and the fact that if you turn off ANC they lose a ton bass and when ANC is on if I move my jaw side to side there is this weird feedback noise for a split second on some songs, like a tone shift in the upper mid/treble region. I does not do that with ANC/Ambient off and it might have been fixed in an update because I don't remember it being that bad before. This is isn't like with normal iems or headphones and a gold plated cable or something, as soon as you involve software there is potential for bugs and edge cases. 

However, soon-ish I will update them and see if it sounds the same. It's possible that I just needed to completely reset them. Though I don't have any way to measure them to get some objective comparisons. But I'm curious, and I can always downgrade again.",TheTomato2,3

I know what you mean by ANC seeming to increase bass. The interesting thing, that isn't seen in measurements. I think it's the removal of the level of incoming noise that increases the perception of bass. It's a real thing, I perceive it that way too. But not in the measurements.

I wonder if it wasn't a change in the tuning but in the ANC, and you use them with ANC.

ANC doing something if you move your jaw, it's probably transmitting a noise to the microphones which ANC then reverses, that doesn't sound odd to me. Some regular IEMs have bad driver flex if I move my jaw, it crinkles the driver due to the pressure. So I don't necessarily find this disqualifying, better if it doesn't but I can live with it.

Everyone (or at least, most people) likes bass, and the recessed mids make it non-fatiguing, for longer listening. If you go straight from something that is recessed in the upper mids to something with Harman (or even IEF neutral- a bit less) upper mids, it can sound very shouty, thin, harsh, AM radio sort of sound. But you can get used to it and I think if you do, you may appreciate more what's in those frequencies. But if you prefer a warm, laid back, dark, non-fatiguing sound... nothing wrong with that, it's a preference.

It's strange that Sennheiser has long been doing these recessed mids on their IEMs when their best known headphones (HD600, HD650, HD800S) are very forward in that region. But I guess that's because that side of it has been led from the ""consumer"" signature. They are moving away from it now with the likes of the IE600 and IE200, which both bring forward the upper mids to more ""audiophile"" levels while also reducing the mid-bass, they still have tons of subbass but those two, the mid-bass comes down.

And more and more even random Chi-Fi TWS now are going more Harman with the bass, even some that are a bit wonky otherwise, it does seem to be getting more popular to cut the mid-bass and boost the sub-bass. Some of these it's probably a bit ""too much"", but there does seem to be more of a move towards trying to keep the bass out of the lower mids, in the last year or two, and more stuff is coming out that's closer to Harman.

I am a programmer and I was thinking along the lines ""did they try to fix that and create a bug or something?"" Because in the upper register and it's really pronounced compared to in the new updates. 

>I wonder if it wasn't a change in the tuning but in the ANC, and you use them with ANC.

Yeah that is what I am thinking now, I literally always have the ANC on. And they would seem to fluctuate a bit in quality but it's really hard to attribute that to the buds themselves or my current mental state or w/e.  I also don't remember having issues when I first got them in march, they might not have been updated though so that isn't something that can be used as a data point. I did just clean some gunk out of the little microphone hole, it was deep in there, though I don't know if that is relevant. But subjectively, I have them in right now I am fully enjoying listening to them and I did not a week ago to a level where I can't attribute it to a placebo effect. And if I put on the D.A.N.C.E. song it's not literally ear piercing for me. Though I am pretty sure I have a lower tolerance for that stuff that most people from my anecdotal experiences. 

The downgraded cleared the serial numbers to 0 and I think because of that they no longer update in the app which means I need to track down the newer firmware and upgrade manually.

I was researching this a couple of days actually. I was on the fence between getting some ear pods to replace my Powerbeats 3. I ultimately had to pick between the Galaxy Buds, Airpods Pro, or the Powerbeats Pro. I even looked at the Echo Buds. All are great buds, but I didn't want to pay more than $200.

I ultimately settled on the Galaxy Buds because of the price, and I've been tracking on them since earlier this year.

I will say this, the sound is very good. I'm not sure how much different it is than the other buds, but for the money you will not be dissapointed.

One quirk though, these buds  don't have noise-cancelling technology. That said, it doesn't need them. I can barely hear the ""outside world"" when I have these on. Even when the volumn turned down/off I have to take my earbuds out if I really want to hear a conversation.

Also, my ears sometimes get tired of the buds if I have it in my ear more than a hour or so. Especially when I'm just sitting around. But, I think my ears have issues with buds with without the external support hook. That said, I simply take them out for a few minutes to rest my ears and I'm fine.

For $110, this is a great purchase.",sreyaNotfilc,265

Here's my take on each, not that you probably care.  Your mileage may vary depending on ears/phone/lunar cycle/whatever.  I used the GB on a Note 8 and APP on an iPhone 11 (not pro).

* GBs do indeed have good sound reproduction for the form factor and price, but I wouldn't say the sound is noticeably better than the APP (though sound-per-dollar they're incredible compared to the APP).

* The GB last for 6 hours on a charge, and that extra 1.5 hours over the APP can be pretty noticeable.  However, the charging case can't go nearly as long as the APP case can (13 hours of total listening vs 24).  How important that is depends on your use case.  I never found I needed more than 1 charge before I had to pop the GB on the charger anyway, and if I had a Samsung phone with 'power share' I could just set the case on the phone to charge it wirelessly (I did not, however).  I don't like to constantly charge things, so it's been nice to go a day or two between charges for the APP, but I didn't mind the routine with the GB that much.

* Call quality on the GB is miserable.  People you're talking to sound fine, but you sound very quiet and unclear on the other end.  APP are leagues ahead here.  Most of the time folks think I'm talking on my phone and not a pair of earbuds.  I think this has been the biggest win for the APP in my book, moreso even than ANC.  Stellar call quality.

* GB don't have ANC like the APP, but the amount of noise they block out passively is pretty impressive.  As far as noise cancellation goes, it's almost as good as what the APP do *actively*.  If you disable ANC on the APP they let in far more noise than the GB.  That said, the ANC on the APP is pretty nice.  It doesn't do a great job at filtering out certain noises, but low, droning sounds like fans, engines, exhaust systems, etc. are almost entirely eliminated by them.  When you put them in it feels like you've gone deaf.  ANC does create a little pressure in the ear, which some folks might find unpleasant.  It was really noticeable to me at first, but I've gotten used to it now.

* If you use the GB in their version of 'transparency mode' the audio piped in sounds like you're standing in a giant aluminum can, whereas APP sound much more natural (though you can still just barely tell the sound is being reproduced).

* If you watch movies with wireless earbuds the GB have noticeably more latency than the APP.  How much that bothers anyone varies - and the GB weren't particularly *bad* in this regard - but the APP had almost no discernible latency to me whereas I could definitely tell on the GB.

* This is absolutely personal preference, but I much prefer squeezing the stem of the APP to tapping the touch pad on the GB.  I found that I would accidentally pause/unpause what I was listening to with the GB when I took a bud out of an ear.  I also like that removing an APP from an ear pauses my media, where the GB don't have an auto-pause feature.  Not a big deal, since you can just tap that touch pad to pause, but you can't accidentally unpause your media with the APP. 

* Also personal preference, but I like the fins on the GB.  I don't suffer any ear fatigue from them, and they add some peace of mind as to how securely they fit my ear.  I've never had the APP slip out, to be fair, but I also feel inclined to check them in my ear a little more often than is probably necessary.

* The APP worked fine on non-Apple devices, and the GB worked fine on non-Samsung devices.  I think the APP have better integration with Apple devices than the GB have integration with Samsung devices, but that's a very minor thing.

TL;DR: Lots of minor differences between them.  The big win for GB is how good they are for the price when compared to the APP.  The extra money from the APP could be worth it, though, if you want ANC, better call quality, and a distortion-free transparency mode.",fnixdown,37

I watched the Mandolorian on my AppleTV with the audio playing through my Airpods pro and it took me three clicks to make it happen. With my phone, I just need to take them out of the case and put them in my ear and it's on. If I take one of the headphones out to talk to someone, it automatically pauses my music and plays again it when I place them back in.

No, sound quality isn't going to be nearly as good as solid wired headphones. I have some wired ATHM50 (Audio Technica, I bought it for $120 or so years ago, so it isn't crazy expensive) and the sound quality difference between the two is noticeable. The wired headphones have much clearer sounds and stronger bass at a lower volume level than I need to use with the Airpods, but that's not why I bought the Airpods Pro. I bought the Pros because I wanted some solid IEMs for the gym and while I'm out. My wired headphones and other over-the-ear headphones are too bulky and uncomfortable to wear for extended periods of time, or carry around, but that's not a problem with the Airpods. I can use them on the treadmill, while I'm lifting, out walking, etc., and the charging case is small enough to fit in my pocket when they're not in use. The sound quality is solid, and combined with how well it works with Apple devices, it's just a good product (not counting the battery eventually becoming useless in 2-3 years.)",None,3

It's one more thing you have to charge (and the batteries will eventually die), the audio quality suffers because the DAC in the earbuds is typically crap, and with these new earbuds that are separate pieces it seems they would be very easy to lose. Imagine you're walking down a busy street, one of them pops out accidentally, lands in the road and immediately gets run over.

Most phones have nixed a headphone jack now, so you're honestly better off getting a decent USB DAC / headphone amp and a pair of in-ear monitors. For example:

[Fiio K1 24-bit 96Khz USB DAC / Amplifier](https://www.amazon.com/K1-Portable-Headphone-Amplifier-DAC/dp/B0189EVGAG/) - $40
Works great, doesn't really drain your battery any more than you would listening to music normally. It's also tiny, light, and has a clip to attach to your clothing. Note that you'll need a USB-C OTG cable, which is another $5 or so.

[KZ ZS10 Pro In-ear Monitors - $48.99](https://www.amazon.com/KZ-ZS10-Linsoul-Earphones-Detachable/dp/B07QKYTGH9/)
I have these, and they sound quite simply amazing. In-ear monitors of this quality were once very expensive, but now we can get them directly from China without a big brand name attached. They have a nice long cord that is replaceable, and they are very comfortable.

This is far less than the cost of the high end wireless earbuds...we're still under $100 total, and if you've never experienced 24/96 audio you don't know what you're missing. Tidal will stream at that quality level, but you probably only want to do that on Wifi. Alternatively, you can take FLAC files around with you on your phone, which is what I do. The whole setup is easy, lightweight, and cheaper than wireless while giving you amazing sound quality that you can *never* get with any wireless headphones.",CrystalSplice,3

The AptX Bluetooth codec is so good now that unless you're in a small proportion of sound engineers, the sound quality will be identical.

If you like sound isolated, in-ears will beat the best active noise cancellation over-ears hands down. Personally, I think the superior isolation of in-ears makes for a better overall sound than the range of on-ears, but it is really personal preference.

Ie “if you are an iPhone user, XYZ is best, if you’re Android, TWY...” I find it interesting that they base it off of the subjective opinion of the reader rather than formulate a method of being completely objective.

Perhaps, at this point, it’s impossible to be objective about branding.

The funny thing about mobile is that people get tribal about it. They begin to identify themselves by the brands they use. This brand identity extends to accessories, too.

I tried to get into audiophile stuff in the past with imported Audio Technica headphones (before they started selling in US) and now these Chinese hifi earbuds. To be honest I find the quality difference to be marginal. Maybe I'm a nontaster when it comes to sound but there's just no way I would also bring a DAC with me on top when traveling. It's not like I don't hear the difference between say the original earpods and my RevoNext, but as long as the sound quality is not so bad that it becomes distracting, it's always outweighed by the hassle of dealing with tangled wires. 

On the other hand I finally got a pair of ANC headphone for air travel and the benefit is so dramatic I would gladly pay a few hundred dollars extra for that feature and will never go without one when flying from now on. Charging is really not that big a hassle since I'm already conditioned to charge my phone regularly. Plugging two or three things instead of one thing in every night doesn't make much of a difference.

I do share your concern with non-replaceable battery though. That's the main reason I still haven't bought a pair of these wireless earbuds. The fact that they can't be disassembled without destroying the casing should be illegal. Imagine hearing aids companies doing the same thing.

In-ear-monitors would like to have a word!

After trying a dozen different pairs of over the ear headphones, I broke down and bought a $500 pair of Shure IEMs (almost a decade ago). They sound amazing whether it's vinyl through a tube amp, a high quality DAC on my computer, or plugged into my phone / laptop / Switch. I don't have to worry about whether they're charged, or whether the bluetooth will be flaky. They're also really amazing at isolating background noise since they go inside your ears like earplugs - no need for fancy active noise canceling. They're a lifesaver when flying, blocking out even the loudest of screaming children. Oh, and since they're in ear, I can blast my music as loud as I want and it's completely inaudible to others - even if someone's laying in bed right next to me in a quiet room.",paracelsus23,1

The price point is certainly a deal breaker for most, so I’ll admit the comparison isn’t as simple as it would be if the Samsung’s were $180+. Their product is a screaming deal at $110. That said, Jabra, Samsung, and Bose need to step their game up in terms of call quality/outside noise reduction, especially at the premium price points (and hopefully at lower ones, too).

Maybe as time goes by, and small battery life becomes plentiful, that an ear bud can simply by as big (or as small) as a typical wired earbud. That way you get the best of both worlds in a smaller package.

Each earbud acts as a separate entity. That is, each bud will turn on and be functional when inside the ear. Once a bud is out, its deactivated from touch, but can still play (if it was previously activated). 

So, if one is low in power or lost, you can still use the one that works. Also, there's a Find Earbud feature in the Samsung Wear app.

If inactive, turning it on is as simple as putting it into the ear. You'll hear a little sound indicating that its ready to go.

Functionally, the buds only control play, pause, next (two taps), and previous (three taps). They also has custom settings for hold tap. Default I think its Bixby, but you can change it from the Samsung Wear app. I changed it for volumn control (left hold = volumn up, right hold = volumn down).

My left ear sometimes has trouble with them while my right ear is fine. I may just need to adjust the sharkfin ear fitter to a smaller size.

Also, for me, earbuds tend to wear out my ears after sometime anyway. I've tried various other buds in the past, some recommend as being totally comfortable, and I always have to take them out after a while.

Just noticed in this case that my left ear gets a bit tired. Millage may vary I guess.

These are pretty good for the price when compared to the $200+ ear buds. So, year I would recommend them if you are on that type of budget. 

Unfortunately, its hard to really try these things out at stores. I can't imagine that a store will let you ""test"" one out for multiple hours. I would say that as long as you have a receipt, then you'll be fine either way (since you can return them).

You either have bad ears, or don’t know what you’re talking about. 

It largely depends on codec obviously, but nearly *all* 128kbps encodes have a *hard* cutoff at 15khz. 

Are you telling me you can’t hear above 15kz? Because if so, that would explain why you think they sound similar. 

256 CBR generally extent up to 18khz, which is closer to being extended out of audible hearing range. Big difference. 

Also, lower bitrate will generally mean (since it was converted from a higher quality source) more inter-sample peaks. That causes distortion. Distortion is pretty audible, and at a bitrate that low, it can easily cause 3-5db peaks that will sound like noise clipping. 

Don’t try to pass off *half* the bit rate as the same, or indistinguishable from 256kbps.",T-Nan,6

I've worked in the technology industry for over 30 years, from 3-person startups to household names, and anecdotally, I've seen zero evidence of this. Compared to its overall unit market share, iOS has been significantly overrepresented in the firms at which I've worked over the last 10 years.

As an aside, I've observed that the same seems to be true of macOS—to some degree since the PowerBook G4 came out in 2001, and even more so since the Intel-based MacBook Pro in 2006. Worldwide, macOS' unit market share hovers around 10%, but walk around a major consumer technology firm in the US and you'd think it was more like 50%.

EDIT: Note that while I use exclusively Apple ecosystem stuff in my personal life, at work I choose (yes, it's my choice) to use Windows. I find it less convenient and more frustrating than macOS, but I don't want to lose fluency with that major platform, and I like the context switch (macOS = personal, Windows = work).

That said, CU fails on so many levels.

For white goods (generic term for appliances) I would suggest staying away from LG or Samsung because they don't have a service presence in the US. Buy a Whirlpool brand (Whirlpool, Maytag, JennAir, Kitchenaid, Amana) since they still have service companies in the US.

I would also consider buying from a not Big Box place. One that actually has a service department.

I would also look for a middle range price. Don't buy the top of the line because there are more electronics to fail, and the bottom of the price range is likely devoid of features that are actually useful. 

The other annoying game that they all play (manufacturers and retailers) is that the retailers demand a different feature set on their products relative to the competitor's product range. So there might be a $800 Whirlpool washer, but it's not the ""same"" washer as what the other retailer down the street sells for $810. Which makes comparison shopping difficult.",Sands43,2

&#x200B;

 Here's a list of ‌AirPods‌ features you lose out on when using the ‌AirPods‌ with Android:  


* [**Siri**](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/). On iPhone, you can tap to access ‌Siri‌ for doing things like changing songs, adjusting volume, or just asking simple questions. If you have ‌AirPods‌ 2, you can also use ""Hey ‌Siri‌"" to activate ‌Siri‌.
* **Customizing Double Tap**. In the Settings app on an iOS device, you can change what the double tap gesture does. Options include accessing ‌Siri‌, Play/Pause, Next Track, and Previous Track.
* **Automatic switching**. ‌AirPods‌ are linked to an [iCloud](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/icloud/) account for Apple users, which allows them to easily switch between using the ‌AirPods‌ with an ‌iPad‌, iPhone, ‌Apple Watch‌, and Mac.
* **Simple setup**. Pairing with an iOS device only requires opening the case near said device and following the quick setup steps.
* **Checking ‌AirPods‌ battery**. On the iPhone and ‌Apple Watch‌, you can ask ‌Siri‌ about the ‌AirPods‌ battery life or check it from the Today center on iPhone or the Control Center on ‌Apple Watch‌. Luckily, there is a way to replace this functionality on Android [with the AirBattery app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=friedrich.georg.airbattery&hl=en_US) or [Assistant Trigger](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dotarrow.assistantTrigger&hl=en_US).
* **Automatic ear detection**. On iPhone, when you remove an AirPod from your ear, it pauses whatever you're listening to until you put the AirPod back into your ear.
* **Single AirPod listening**. Listening to music with a single AirPod is limited to iOS devices because it uses ear detection functionality. On Android, you need to have both ‌AirPods‌ out of the case for them to connect.",TJNel,9

Wireless is inherently worse sound quality wise than wired. I have no doubt they're both decent, or quite possibly even among the best, for wireless ear buds but they still will lose to the best sounding headphones even within their price range.

Therefore, if someone is looking for the best possible sound, they most definitely won't pick either. Both of those products are made for consumers who are willing to sacrifice a bit of sound quality for the numerous usability (and possibly style) gains those tiny wireless buds offer over massive and wired slightly better sounding options.

Open up ""spek"" or any spectrogram and there is plenty of information up there. Sibilance, high end from any hat, crash, or bright sound, etc. If there wasn't ""not much above 15khz"", codecs wouldn't extend up to 22khz. 

Unless you're exclusively listening to music from the 60s and earlier, everything extends past 15khz, easily.

And by that, you're agreeing with the point of the comment above you.

Xerox Alto was the first computer designed with a GUI and a mouse, in 1973.  Steve Jobs visited Xerox PARC in 1979, saw the Alto and ""borrowed"" and refined the concepts for the Lisa/Mac.

Apple innovated on other mp3 players as you suggested, they took an existing idea and refined it.

I had a few smartphones before the iPhone was released (Sony Ericsson P800 and P900, and an iPaq), and while a more modern smartphone is obviously more advanced, when the iPhone first came out, it didn't even support apps.  Apple was riding high on the popularity of the iMac and good marketing though.  

There were a few ok at best Android tablets prior to the iPad too, you could argue that the iPad was more mainstream and offered a better user experience, which is fair, but it's still not innovative to refine an existing product. 

I 100% agree that Apple is great at popularising technology, and refining UX, but to credit them with inventing new tech in the last 30-ish years is a bit laughable.

The AirPods transparency mode is much better than the Sony ambient mode.

My point was, without Jobs and Apple, who knows what computers look like today. The Xerox Alto sold 2000 units in total. It was a novelty item, nobody actually bought or used them. 

The Lisa and later the Macintosh really revolutionized computing. They bought GUI and Mouse use to the mainstream. So sure, invented is the wrong word. But without them computers as we know it today likely don't exist.

People hate to acknowledge it but Apple is the reason we have personal computers today. Sure, it's possible Xerox or Microsoft would've found a way to eventually come around to what we know today. But that's not what history is, fact is Apple is the reason a LOT of our technology we use today exists. 

Without them, the modern personal PC doesn't exist, without them the modern smartphone doesn't exist, without them the modern tablet doesn't exist. 

> inventing new tech in the last 30-ish years is a bit laughable.

To be fair, I didn't credit them with inventing anything in the last 30 years. Mouse + GUI was longer than 30 years ago. The correct word though is innovation. 

They are probably the most influential tech company in the world, whether we like it or not. It's almost sad watching them slowly devolve into this mess of a company since Jobs death. I really wish Jobs had spent more time grooming a successor properly and managed to find a younger version of himself. Instead, we got Tim Cook and the rest is history. 

I also do agree that Woz did most of the actual inventing at Apple. But I do struggle with people who give him all the credit. 

Woz and Jobs had one of the worst and best relationships ever in tech really. Jobs would have a vision of something and Woz was able to take that vision and make it a product and Jobs was probably one of the best marketers in modern history and knew how to sell his vision. 

Needless to say, I can't stand the cult behavior behind Apple. I don't use really any of their products. But while he was a real asshole for most of his life, I'll never stop looking up to Jobs for what he did for modern technology. Sure, he wasn't the man making most of their products but he was without question a visionary in the space.",Uther-Lightbringer,0

I would argue they're not 'innovative' now. During Jobs tenure, they not only made certain fringe products popular (personal computer, mp3 player, smartphone, tablet etc) but they also turned them into VASTLY better products than what currently existed.

I would argue now, simply due to the ecosystem and fanbase. That they no longer innovate. But more so they can bring out an equally or inferior product these days and still popularize an entirely new space. Lets be frank, the Apple Watch isn't that great. There were much better watches before it, there are much better smart watches now and there will be better smart watches in the future as well. Same goes for Airpods. 

The glasses could maybe be impressive and revolutionary if they're actually available in various styles and functional. But I doubt they will be, we'll see though.

Are you looking for true wireless earbuds or studio headphones?  As far as studio headphones or true wireless earbuds go it depends on your budget. At the beginning of this year (prices and selections have improved since then) I bought all of them at the same time. I tried Apple AirPods, Bose sound sports, Jabra elites 65t, and the Sony 1000s. At the time they all fell into the sub $250 range. 

Having owned many of Bose headphones over the years, I was always happy with the overall quality of sound and build quality for the price. That changed when the last wired Bose earbuds I bought started to fall apart in less than a year. Their sound sports had above average sound quality, better than the apple and Sony, but the fact I had already been dealing with poor quality workmanship from Bose lowered my enthusiasm to spend $199 on them. 

Apple ear pods work like they are suppose to, easy to pair, and good battery life, but lack any real depth in sound, and didn’t stay in my ears well.

The Sony 1000s were just all around lack luster and really seemed to be selling a bunch of options that weren’t really needed or mattered. Especially for the price at the time which was around $220 if I recall. 

Ended up going with the Jabra elites 65t at the time they were $240 I think. The sound quality was rich with great bass and midrange, along with highs that were crisp and clear.  Came with multiple ear pieces to allow for good comfortable fitment, definitely the most comfortable and securely fitting out the group I tried. I would say Bose was close second in comfort, and sound.  The Jabra charging case and earbud battery life is great, phone calls work well, they have a pass through sound setting so you can have them on at work and still hear when someone speaks to you. It’s almost been a year since I’ve bought them and I’m totally happy still. 


As far as studio headphones go, I would highly recommend looking into Sennheiser. They have a very large line of headphones to match almost any budget . They are a company that has been around a long time and have always produced high quality audiophile level equipment.  Even their lower price sets will impress your with their sound quality. 

They also have a very nice set of true wireless earbuds, but they were out of my price range at the time I was choosing.",CarbonReflections,2

Right, and I didn't claim it did. That's really not the point. This is a thread about the GB having better sound quality than the others, and how someone said you should buy the one that fits your brand.

My point was you should buy the ones that fit your criteria. You don't just pick whatever because you can't have the best of all worlds. If sound quality is your second highest priority, you'd pick the GB. 

I wasn't going to get into the weeds about every possible feature because it doesn't really matter. You pick what fits what you want best. If you want sound quality and truly wireless, but don't care about the rest, GB are your go-to. If you want ANC more than you care about sound quality, then maybe you go with the airpods.

If you are listening to Apple Music or an AAC audio track on an iDevice or Mac through Airpods, then there is no drop in quality because Apple has designed the ecosystem in such a way that there is no need to re-encode the audio (assuming decent gain and a low SNR). On the other hand, if you change any of these parameters you will risk breaking the chain that makes this possible and will lower the quality of the audio.

The reason why people are so happy with bluetooth is that everything is kept secret from the user. You don't know how often the connection speed has to drop because of radio interferance, and you probably aren't noticing the occasional drops in audio quality that result from them. Even the underlying codecs are kept extremely vague; They are marked as supporting AptX, which is a brand name covering multiple codecs, or as supporting MP4, which is just a container that can handle an even greater number of audio codecs.

No, yes. No. They are identical to every other set of Chinese factory bluetooth earbuds.

Never experienced that and I've apparently got significantly more experience.

>They can be connected to more than one device at the same time, and switching from iPhone to MacBook literally takes 2 seconds. 

I don't care because I'm not stupid enough to own those products. I like generic products that work with all my stuff, not arbitrary attempts to make me buy everything from one company. I've got a 2012 Macbook Pro kicking around but I certainly wouldn't buy any of their current offerings.

>They pause when you take one off and play when you put it back in. The audio switched to mono when you use only one AirPod.

It sure is, just like MacBook Air when it comes to exceptional design. But I wouldn’t say it’s defined laptops, nor did Apple invent the laptop. 
  
Smart watches have been around since forever, and one of the best watches for its time was the pebble. The Samsung watch was popular first and finally a year later after Samsung’s first watch came out Apple Watch. Again, I think you and I are speaking to different things. Microsoft failed with the zune because Apple had invented the ideal media device. Apple hasn’t maneuvered in the same skill set as when they made the zune obsolete. If the technological success of Apple was the same now as it is today, we wouldn’t see any other laptops, watches, pens, external hard drives, headphones, etc. What we don’t see? Zunes, skip-free CD players, etc. 
  
I understand that you believe that apples worth, and branding prominence compared to other vendors makes it amazing! And you’re definitely entitled to that and I don’t necessarily disagree as I type from an iPhone and my Apple Watch is charging.

It’s an example that anyone could understand because he is known for his nonsensical ramblings. Nobody is “making it political”, you’re just failing to see why I said it and jumping to that conclusion. An **example**.

> Smart watches have been around since forever, and one of the best watches for its time was the pebble. The Samsung watch was popular first and finally a year later after Samsung’s first watch came out Apple Watch. Again, I think you and I are speaking to different things. Microsoft failed with the zune because Apple had invented the ideal media device. Apple hasn’t maneuvered in the same skill set as when they made the zune obsolete. If the technological success of Apple was the same now as it is today, we wouldn’t see any other laptops, watches, pens, external hard drives, headphones, etc. What we don’t see? Zunes, skip-free CD players, etc.

A whole bunch of word salad about the history of personal media devices. Feel free to address the Apple Watch's dominance in the smart watch market in 2019. Or just keep talking about the Zune and shit. Whatever.

Apple's chip design is world class and I bet you'd just talk about how ""semiconductors have been around for years and Apple did not invent them"" while ignoring that every other company on earth is trying to catch up to where Apple was 3 years ago.

Sony is fine, but honestly I lost my first two galaxy buds and then have managed to hold onto the sonys but the battery is getting worse, the one pair of LinkBuds have a garbage mic (the open ones). The other pair sounds really nice but not significantly better than the only buds+ I had with way better battery and a nicer, less heavy fit IMO.

I've never owned the pro 2's yet but I'd say they are 100% worth it just based on the research I've done. To me, it seems like the best options are as follows:

**Soundcore liberty** for budget sound. Most earbuds in its price range have bad mics or other issues.

**Galaxy buds/Air pods/OnePlus** depending on your phone. Sony ones if you're willing to take the risk of having battery problems. Same as above. Most headphones in this range have glaring issues in some form but these 3 brands have no abysmally bad features.

**Gemini II/Audio Technica AZ80(?)** if you have money and want a premium pair of earbuds.

Honest to God though, I've never found a pair of earbuds that hit like the galaxy buds in battery life, mic quality, build quality, and overall consistent performance for its price.

If the Buds2 Pro are sitting at full price and you've got alternatives like the WF-1000XM4 and OnePlus Buds Pro 2 at a lower price point, it's definitely worth considering those.

These are the ones I've actually owned, minus the WF-1000XM3 (which I omitted, as I don't think you can find it anymore at regular retail), and I can provide honest feedback.  
  
In terms of ANC performance, Sony takes the cake, followed by Galaxy Buds and then OnePlus Buds. Sony's ANC is pretty much the gold standard here, Galaxy Buds2 Pro are actually pretty good, and I can say this from personal experience, since I work in a seriously noisy place. OnePlus Buds might not be your best bet, mostly because their passive noise isolation is borderline awful, letting more noise in.

  
Onto the sound quality breakdown:  
  
WF-1000XM4: These provide the warmest and most laid-back listening experience for my ear out of this bunch. The bass is powerful and deep, yet well-controlled. The mids have a decent presence, but there's a noticeable dip in the range of 2k Hz to about 8k, making it sound slightly more recessed compared to others on this list. The same goes for the treble, with a strong dip around 12k Hz, resulting in the sound being more muffled than the rest. That being said, it is a great option if you're sensitive to trebles and a solid choice overall.  
  
Galaxy Buds2 Pro: If you ever happen to listen to these side by side with Sony's, the comparison may be quite jarring. Unlike Sony's, these aren't afraid to let that treble shine through. They offer a confident, in-your-face type of sound. In terms of quantity, there's slightly less bass (really not that much) compared to Sony's, but quality-wise, they are on par. Both have a rich presence and impact. The midrange is slightly more pronounced here, but the most significant difference lies in the treble. If you happen to be sensitive to treble, these may come off as shouty and sibilant. Personally, I love my treble, and that's why I prefer these over the XM4's. Another thing to think about is the high bitrate Samsung Seamless Codec, which I believe is supported on Galaxy devices starting from One UI 4.0.  
  
OnePlus Buds Pro 2: In terms of audio, these fall somewhere in between Sony's and Galaxy's. There's a lot of bass here, even more so than the other two. While it delivers a nice impact, it doesn't feel as deep as its competitors. On default settings, the mids are on par with Sony's, and the treble, while not as defined as Galaxy's, also lacks the strong dip seen in Sony's. That being said, they are by no means worse, and this sound profile might be right up your alley. It's also worth noting that the customization options on these surpass both Sony's and Galaxy's. In addition to a personalized ""golden sound"" equalizer, you have access to a regular 6-band one and various presets.

When it comes to software, especially since you've got the S21 FE, the Buds2 Pro might score a little extra. The controls and overall experience just feel smooth and polished. Sony's app is pretty solid too, offering some decent customization and reliability. Now, OnePlus and their HeyMelody app, well, it's the weakest link here. It's got this kind of ""chinese"" software vibe, and overall, it's not as stable as the other two.

  
It really boils down to what you're looking for in terms of sound and your budget. Hope you find this somewhat helpful",Cream_Necessary,1

MY comparison between Sony's WF XM4 & Buds Pro 2:

Sound: Buds Pro 2 sounds better. Now, don't get me wrong, Sony has always been up front in Audio Engineering. They're one of the best, if not the best. But Samsung's Codec really makes a difference! Use them with Apple Music Lossless & you can totally hear the difference (I use a Samsung Galaxy S23U).

ANC: Sony wins. No contest. Samsung's Pro 2 has a decent ANC, but against Sony's? They have no chance of winning.

Price: I got my Buds Pro for $149. My Sony's cost me $170 at the time, but should be cheaper by now.

Fit: Buds Pro 2. All the way. Sony's made my ears hurt after a while of using them, Buds fit perfectly. I will add, though; Buds Pro 2 don't feel as secure when working out as the Sony's did.

First problem is that they don't fit my ears. The tips connecting part is too short, and any tips you use with it will be closer to the base of the earbuds than your typical earbuds. The base had a large round hump which is incompatible with my ears because it seeks to push outwards from my ears whenever my face makes a light movement. The stock tips are especially short and unusable with the earbuds for me because it brought the large round hump closer to my ears. So every time I smile or talk, the earbuds would become loose and lose proper seal. Tips too long, and the earbuds won't fit inside of the charging case. Because of the large round humps, I had great difficulty trying to fit them in my ears in the first place. >90% of the times I wear them with the stock tips, I would get a failed seal test. With my own tips, they fit in my ears a lot better, but becomes more difficult to fit inside of the charging case. I primarily use ""ML size"", which is not included with the stock tips, since they only provided what I would describe as ""XS, M and XL size tips"". That's a total of only three sets of tips. All of which are too short for me including the ""XL sized"" one. Because tips too long, and it would have trouble fitting inside of the case.

Another problem I encountered was that the sound was very fatiguing out of the box which means I would have had to use custom EQ with them. The Samsung app doesn't seem to provide a custom EQ function. I also just didn't like the sound signature in general and I don't know if any EQing would fix that completely. I didn't bother going through the trouble of custom EQing with a 3rd party app because they didn't fit my ears anyways. But I did try the EQ presets provided with the Samsung app, and I did not like any of them. There was one that was at least listenable for me which was the ""soft"" mode due to it being the least fatiguing. But most people in this sub seem to like that one the least.

Third problem I countered was that it makes a piercing mic sound every time I try to put them on which I find very annoying.

I also later discovered that they don't have multipoint function. My 80 dollar headphones have that function.

Based on the negative experience I've encountered, I would probably want to stay away from Samsung earbuds altogether. Even though I use a galaxy phone.",DreamIn240p,1

You push them in a tiny bit and the tips will make a seal and stay in because of the suction force. This is where I assume most everyone fucks up because they think they need to jam every earbud halfway down their ear canal. I'm not using stock tips but those stayed in fine but my spinfits don't budge. Like I sneeze and they don't budge. And if I push them in too far they collapse and break the seal which makes them fall out and all that shit. 

The thing about shallow fits is if you don't have the right size tips for your ear, which might be different than other earbuds, and/or you put them too deep and/or a bad angle and you won't make a seal they won't stay in. The key is the seal. You have to get the seal.  The seal.",TheTomato2,2

Like, I have some Momentum True Wireless 3s and they go deeper in your ear and catch the inside of your outer ear to stay in and the seal is mostly just for sound. Even the plain buds 2 go a lot deeper. And yeah if you have too big eartips and they are deep in your ear canal you can have that issue you had but buds 2 pro sit *right at the entrance of your ear canal* so it shouldn't really be a problem. 

And just this next part not just for you but anyone else googling this shit because I know it can be incredibly frustrating and I have seen so many posts here about them falling out:

The buds 2 pro are 100% designed around the seal keeping them in because they are: 

1.) shallow

2.) very light

3.) small
 
To give you an idea, when I use the large cp360 tips, which are too big for my ear because they kind of slowly push themselves out, they still make a seal but they poke out a bit and because the angle of my ear canal body of the earbud *doesn't even really touch my ear* and they still won't budge like if I *vigorously* shake my head. And I just push them in lightly ( I have to angle the top of my buds more up because of my ear shape) and they stay.  If you aren't able to get a decent seal, and I think 99% of people can with some finicking and the right eartips (and the stock eartips aren't bad), these aren't worth using. They just won't sound good, they have won't have good ANC and they won't stay in. Get something that you can jam farther in your ear and/or with wingtips.

Also people like the comply foam tips because they will conform and make a seal almost automatically, but I would guess 90% of the time it's more user error that they are covering. Personally for me they muffle the sound a bit (I even cut out the stupid ear wax guard to try to mitigate it), and because they go deeper in my ear canal and because of the shape of my ear canal they create this horrible sibilance in the upper treble region because these buds have a spike around 8k region to compensate for the shallower fit. I've been read about people with sibilance issues with these and I wonder how many are just jamming them in too far. Like I have wonky ear canals that immediately bend to the back of my head and taper a lot (which is why I like spinfits over stock and the azla's ) and I alway shave sibilance issue with bad fits in any earbuds so if can fix it I *would think* most people can. But I am also not any ear-ologist and Samsung *may have* designed this for asian ears (I say that because its not as uncommon as you would think for japanese/korean companies) or something and there is nothing you can do, idk.  

And it should go without saying, clean your damn ears. Too much earwax and it doesn't matter what eartips you use, they will slide out because that is literally what earwax is designed to do.",TheTomato2,2

This must be a paid promotion because I have the complete opposite to say. I am 30 years old so I've seen the wireless buds market come up from nothing. I have bought every new pair a year for the past idk 7 years or so maybe more. For 200$ then what you got was crazy, wireless buds that sounded good. Battery life wasn't a thought nor water proof. Well every year I spent around 200 on decent earbuds so I have experience. I have come to know what is good and what isn't and with the buds 2 pro they are lacking. The one perk is the waterproofing. They are literally the same buds as the buds 2 that cost half the price. Only difference? The speak to chat that does NOT work reliably so I still have to take a bud out to talk because I can't wait to see if it decided to go to ambient mode this time. And another killer is the battery life, 4 hours on my week old buds 2 pro. I also have the Sony wx1000xm4 which cost 279 I think and man those are where it's at because the speak to chat works every single time and I legit can get 8 hours of playback. I kind of took them for granted and always wondered if the buds 2 pro were better or even the same and I can confidently say the sonys are by far the best.  And if your considering the buds pro 2, just get the buds 2 and save your money. And to the mic I legit have to disconnect and use speaker because no one can ever hear me(in parked car with my galaxy fold 4) ear tips are the worst I've seen but that's the same for buds 2.

Biggest con of samsung products is their focus on marketing the bullshit. Whether is MP race for camera or 24-bit here which adds little value.

Sound quality is hands down the best I've heard. The ambient mode is good when walking around places where you need more spatial awareness.

ANC is eh. It's fine, very effective in low frequency noise cancellation but I think airpods Pro had better ANC. It's not bad, most useful in cutting the engine noise when I'm traveling in a noisy bus or train. 

Oh and calls!  I've tested them in very noisy environments. People on the other end could hear me and no noise. Except when a huge plane was passing above me, mom said everything went silent for a few seconds.

I have not tried buds and APP2, but coming from a wireless buds vs dusk:
1. Massive difference in terms of the the details and resolution
2. Dusk is weird IEM thus not portable and ANC etc..
3. Dusk DSP works with iphone 15 as i’ve tried it on my Ip15PM.

Long story short, isit mind blowing? yes if you are coming from a comparison vs Galaxy buds and APP2.

A few years back I accidentally reused old earplugs (trying ironically to protect my hearing). When I woke up the next morning I got out of bed and fell on my face.

My left ear was pretty obviously infected. Internist makes quick appt, puts me on an antibiotic. I take the pills religiously, but it wasn't clearing up. I got busy at work and it took a few days to see doc again. 

This time he gave me the strong stuff, guaranteed to leave a type 1 diabetic like me with a yeast infection, so I got him to prescribe something for that to avoid third visit, promising to wait til I was done with the antibiotics.

Ear infection clears up. Hearing loss doesn't. I saw an audiologist and I had 30% hearing loss in left ear.

My (pretty good) insurance at the time had something like an $800 copay on hearing aids. I paid $1500 for a $2300 aid and lost it in a server room about six months later. With all the fans on I used to remove it when working in them. Client  ""didn't find it"" (assuming he even looked).

I have had a lifelong habit of always walking on the right of someone. Haven't been able to shake the habit in the 14 yrs since my hearing loss. I can't really hear someone clearly to the left of me.

If I were you I wouldn't use earbuds just because of the damage the music is probably doing to your ears, let alone a stray bit of earwax getting moldy and you don't notice or clean it sufficiently.

When you have hearing loss in both ears most American healthcare plans will assume you lost your hearing via lifestyle choices (""This one goes up to 11!""). They don't like buying aids even for single ear losses.",Master-Collection488,4

After letting my ears recover. I started trying other tips, thinking that they were the issue, being the part inside my ear canal.  All were an issue eventually (some worked for a couple times, but then caused irritation) though Azla Crystal tips seemed to solve it.

I hadn't used the buds for several weeks and wore them for just an hour.  That night, the soreness and watery discharge occurred once more.  I was done with Samsung.  I was 3 weeks outside the Jan 31 extended Amazon return date.  Contacted Samsung.

The first chat resulted in a ticket #.  Then someone called me and gave me another ticket #, asking for an email of my receipt and a photo of my ear.  I said my ear showed nothing externally, so sent photos of the Q-tips I used!  They also sent me a HUGE box, with pre-paid labels to return the tiny buds to an individual in Plano TX.   

Someone else then called and asked for me to send the email.  i said I have!   She searched my ticket # and said she found it and apologized! 

Eventually, I got an email confirming, as a ""courtesy"", a refund, but only if I sent a picture of my ear.  It didn't matter that it showed nothing.   So, they got one! (I think Samsung are farming ear shapes for future bud design)  I was later to receive another email with an link to confirm how I want my refund paid.   Yet another number to access that link.  I'm still waiting after a week!

Samsung has the most cumbersome customer service process I've come across.  Other OEMs fix it on the first call/chat!!

I mentioned the irritation to my Doctor and my thoughts about the tips.  He said the ear is very sensitive and the ear canal can react to irritation outside the ear.  So, the buds body or charging contacts could be the problem.  The last irritation resulted in a crusty skin outside my ear, which never occurred before.  Taking longer to heal. 

I have many other ear buds and never had an issue before.  Now, I'm finding occasionally they also cause irritation.  My ears seem more sensitive and troublesome now.

I hate this. 3.5mm IEMs or headphones will work the same regardless of what device you use. USB-C is the same, even more identical since they have their own DAC. But Bluetooth? Oh boy are you in for a shitty experience when you take one of these ecosystem earbuds to another platform. Samsung has its own proprietary codec, Apple uses an optimized AAC, which most other manufacturers use a shittier version. Sony has LDAC, it's in ASOP but still basically proprietary. You have Qualcomm with aptx versions, but Samsung stopped supporting it and apple never did. SBC sucks.

It's a fucking mess. And it's made even worse because Samsung won't even produce and sell you a BT dongle that supports their codec for PC or Mac. So you're stuck with shitty SBC or AAC.

I mentioned the surface laptop, that was a real thing.

Turns out the problem was incredibly niche and hardly affected anyone at all. It's just that the only people who were talking about it were the ones that were affected by it.

I suspect the same is true here, as is usually the case with things like that. There's a handful of people who have had some variant of a problem with their gbuds, people on reddit see a bunch of these comments, and freak out about gbuds. The thing they're missing is that for every comment on here of someone complaining about this there's probably 10,000 other users who have gbuds with no issues.

1. You always get treatment you need. No financial checks are done, ever, for any treatment you need.

The Pixel Buds Pro are a great alternative, especially considering they're 40% off right now, comfortable fit, custom EQ, better volume controls, and a great companion app even if you don't have a Pixel phone.

That's not to downplay the value of the Buds FE, for their MSRP, they're great, but they were missing a couple small features that turned out to be deal breakers for me, like having to choose between Sound Modes and volume controls for a long press control. Plus, the bass can be really loose and woofy, which I experienced on some tracks that put me off a bit. Otherwise, they are great, and were super comfortable.

You can also undercut the value of the Buds FE and go for something like the Soundcore Space A40, which has really good reviews.

If you're deadset on Galaxy Buds, I'd say start out with the Buds2 Pro to see if the fit/comfort works for you, because if they do, they're 100% the better and more features packed earbud.

Recently I decided to get the 2 Pros, and while I don't think I'll fawn over how seamlessly they fit in my ears, I have had no issues with comfort (I had had some issue with the original buds Pro, if that tells you anything), they isolate noise very well with ANC, and primarily I ofc got them for sound quality. Another plus over the FEs is wireless charging (which is actually not relevant for me), and water resistance (which is very relevant for me).

  


Voice detect - I can't really think of any reason I'd use that feature, lol.

The trick is foam ear tips. With the stock silicone tips, the sound is just too tinny and fatiguing and the ANC is just alright.

The ANC is also drastically improved due to the higher frequencies that they normally have a hard time with being cancelled by the foam.

The Pixel Buds Pro are a great alternative, especially considering they're 40% off right now, comfortable fit, custom EQ, better volume controls, and a great companion app even if you don't have a Pixel phone.

That's not to downplay the value of the Buds FE, for their MSRP, they're great, but they were missing a couple small features that turned out to be deal breakers for me, like having to choose between Sound Modes and volume controls for a long press control. Plus, the bass can be really loose and woofy, which I experienced on some tracks that put me off a bit. Otherwise, they are great, and were super comfortable.

You can also undercut the value of the Buds FE and go for something like the Soundcore Space A40, which has really good reviews.

If you're deadset on Galaxy Buds, I'd say start out with the Buds2 Pro to see if the fit/comfort works for you, because if they do, they're 100% the better and more features packed earbud. They didn't work out for me, but my wife loves them. If you can, buy from a store with a good return policy. If they don't work out, give the Buds FE a try.",zjb29877,3

Since then, I have used the buds Live and often I would straight up forget that I have a bud in one of my ears, because they let sound through pretty well and are very comfortable.

  


Recently I decided to get the 2 Pros, and while I don't think I'll fawn over how seamlessly they fit in my ears, I have had no issues with comfort (I had had some issue with the original buds Pro, if that tells you anything), they isolate noise very well with ANC, and primarily I ofc got them for sound quality. Another plus over the FEs is wireless charging (which is actually not relevant for me), and water resistance (which is very relevant for me).

  


Voice detect - I can't really think of any reason I'd use that feature, lol.

  


All in all, if you want some good sound depth and bass, try to look for a good deal on 2 pro, but if comfort is a concerning uncertainty for you, maybe see if you can try them on somewhere before buying. Try on FE while you're at it",KumoNin,1

The trick is foam ear tips. With the stock silicone tips, the sound is just too tinny and fatiguing and the ANC is just alright. But with foam ear tips, the lower end is much fuller and the tinny sounding highs are suppressed for a much more pleasing and comfortable sound. The ANC is also drastically improved due to the higher frequencies that they normally have a hard time with being cancelled by the foam.

The FE are just a more affoedable version, probably not even a better value as the Buds2 Pro can be had for barely over a hungie on Amazon right now. (Under if you opt for Amazon Renewed!)",xblackbeltninjax,1

I still don't think it's that easy to compare with the Buds2 Pro as it is in a different league on its own. However, these Buds FE does put the Pro to shame in more ways than one because it does what it should really well. ANC is surprisingly well executed, the sound quality from a single driver setup is very well done and the price for what they offer is just so good.

I own the Buds Pro and Buds 2 as well, and all sound great, but the Buds FE is particularly strong at bass and noise cancelling.

It's just a pity that only one set of functions can be mapped onto the touch pads eg. either volume control or noise cancellation toggle. With the Buds Pro and Buds 2, there's edge tapping for volume, leaving the touch pad free to for noise cancellation toggling.

You'd have to toggle the settings on your phone for the Buds FE, but it's a minor inconvenience considering the price. I would say that it's the standout in the recently released FE lineup of the phone, tablet and buds.",sabershirou,1

On the EQ, the app isn’t great. To your point, it doesn’t let you adjust by frequency until 400Hz, which is really lower mids. It piles all the bass frequencies together with the “clear bass” slider, which is bit annoying, but luckily the tune out of the box works for me 🙂",Gizm0Guru,2

Similar to you, my AirPods are the worst in terms of stability of all of the buds I own. They create a seal, but I would call it more of a “gentle sit in your ear seal”. 

The XM5s are definitely a bit more firm, partially because the tips are foam versus silicone/rubber, and they go slightly deeper into the ear. They definitely stay in my ears better than the AirPods. I can dance around in them no issue. 

However, I still would not say they are great for working out, and for this, the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 are the better choice. This is because along with multiple tips, they also include wings to provide stability against the back part of your ear. They are my primary workout buds. Definitely not a sacrifice in terms of sound quality (arguably better), though the ANC isn’t quite as good, and you may have to EQ the bass down a bit and mids up, which is easy to do in the app and works well.",Gizm0Guru,1

With all three, you can sit with nothing playing, turn on ANC and block out 80%+ of the sound I’d say (not scientific of course). But whether you can get to 100% depends on what the outside noise is.

And then just that if you do feel the mid-bass is a *little* too much, -1 or -2dB at 400Hz really cleans it up a lot. I get that the 400Hz is limiting but it has a Q either side and I find this one effectively brings down the mid-bass and the bleed into the lower mids. I actually go -1 at 400 and +1 on the ""Clear Bass"", this gives a very effective cut in the mid-bass while leaving the sub-bass about where it was.

This is what I end up with (actual measurement):

Automatic connection switching between your devices. XM5s only support two connections, so if you’re like me and have a phone, tablet, computer, TV, etc., then you’re constantly repairing across devices. 

Spatial audio (including personalized for your ears and head tracking) that is embedded in the OS, so it works with only a couple of clicks. With the XM5s you have to enable a bunch of stuff in the Sony app (which requires signing up for an account), then turning on the setting in individual apps. Also iOS only supports spatial audio for video with AirPods and a Beats, so for video you simply won’t have the option. 

Transparency mode that automatically blocks out loud noises. XM5s don’t have this. ANC mode that automatically lets in voices (coming in iOS 17).  XM5s have this but it is imbedded within the app settings. 

Just in general, everything has to be done within the app instead of right on your system. Even checking the battery level of the case is a minor inconvenience lol. Us spoiled Apple people lol 

It’s nothing that makes them not usable - I still will be using these a lot, but that’s because I’m a headphone geek and am used to having tons of different devices for the sake of sound and even plugging in portable DACs and such.

However, what you’re trying to do in general (block out voices) is very tough for all devices in general. 

If you think about how ANC works, in simple terms, it hears what’s around you and blasts opposing frequencies into your ears to cancel out the noise. This is though to do for vocal frequencies because it’s the same area of the frequency spectrum that’s important for music. That’s why ANC is better at low rumbles (planes, HVACs,) and high pitched frequencies. I’ve yet to come across any device that can block out people while nothing is playing.

I get that the APP has a lot of tech. I love that you can switch between passthrough audio and ANC in the span of 2-3 seconds; I do this when I transition between public transit and walking outdoors. Wireless is convenient, too - nothing to tangle or yank. 

But there are two factors I’ve encountered that make me hesitate to upgrade. Firstly, when I am out of my home, sound quality automatically takes a hit because of the environmental noises. That can’t be helped unless I wear Etymotics, but those isolate too well and take away situational awareness. 

Secondly, wireless interference is a thing. I don’t own a car so I take public transit when going to places. When the bus or train is packed, especially during rush hour, I notice a fair bit of audio clipping.

I wasn’t aware of the issue until I looked it up.

So yes, XM5 or anything else is not going to change that, it's an IEM thing in general. But ANC could make it worse.

You can avoid it with earbuds that *don't* seal (like the non-pro Airpods, or Galaxy Beans). But they have severe compromise in the sound quality and huge bass roll-off in particular. I would pick something like that if I had to use a headset for making calls where I had to talk though.",blorg,1

You can vary it a bit with tips, Tangzu Tang Sancai for example have a textured skin that is designed to slightly break the seal and relieve ear pressure. The trade-off is lower perceived bass intensity (but some IEMs are too bassy as is, so this can be a positive with some).

* Mid and high bass are fine, but low bass rolls off from 30hz to 20hz, just like the XM4's. SoundGuys.com (and Rtings.com XM4) frequency chart confirms this. 20hz is where you get the deep seat-rumbling type of bass. If you listen to a lot of hip-hop or Altanta Trap from producers like Metro Boomin', you're going to prefer the bass of the MTW3's. But if you listen to other music where the bass isn't the star of the show, you might prefer the more accurate treble of the XM5's. - The low bass line to Beyonce's ""Heated"" is mostly missing behind the rest of the sounds. Or listening to the second half of Kanye West's ""Say You Will"" from 808 and Heartbreaks, or the intro to Nipsey Hussle's Blue Laces 2 shows how in comparison to the MTW3's, there's not as much ""rumble"" to the low bass. The XM5's definitely have a lot and enough bass, but it's just missing that x-factor that I'm looking for.
* Music doesn't sound as immersive, maybe due in part to the missing low-end bass. If the star of the show is missing, you can't really enjoy the music. But overall, the soundstage feels smaller.
* The XM5's definitely sound better than I remember the XM4's sounding. The treble is not muddy.
* The small eartips do not fully seal my ear, and the medium ear tips seem too big to really get into my ear. I tried the squeeze and insert method where you compress the foam and try to insert it into your ears before it expands. This didn't work well. The fit never really feels secure. I don't think it's realistic to workout with these on. Like if you're eating and your jaw is moving, anticipate the seal slowly degrading and being compromised.
* While the XM5's do sound OK out of the box, they do not EQ well. It doesn't seem like bass can really be improved from out of the box. Soundstage cannot be fixed. If not for the lack of bass I'd probably be content with the overall sound. The Sennheiser's have a ""My Sound"" Personalized EQ feature that is easily customizable and just absolutely kills the XM5's because you can really fine tune the EQ in an intuitive way that helps you get the earbuds to sound like how you want them to sound. The Sony's do have a custom EQ wizard, but it's just not as good and doesn't impact the actual sound as much.",None,2

It's physically narrower, that much seems obvious. How it affects comfort is unknown, as it's a completely different type of headband, not just a narrowed version of the previous design. I don't expect this design to sacrifice comfort. This series is one of Sony's prime golden gees in an ever fiercer competition market. Allowing design changes that significantly conpromises user comfort for a large portion of potential customers, would be a huge no-no. Especially in this market as it is, because user comfort is one big area where Bose is still ahead of Sony in this market segment. Sony allowing that gap to further widen would be a huge mistake. That would push even more potential customers towards Bose instead, decrese sales and ROI for Sony despite their electronics improvements both in their own right and versus what Bose offers. Because no amount of top shelf electronics is gonna save a product that is uncomfortable to use. This would allow Bose a strong chance to catch up in the electronics department while Sony ""is stuck"" spending much of the work on the next version addressing selfinflicted wounds (comfort issue).",prollie,1

Even for my own research I’ve basically read all ANC cans sound mediocre at best. I’m worried sound imbalance down the line.

I don't have a precise hour figure for how long it holds up, but I go days between recharging. I also have not noticed any sound imbalance.

General consensus seems to be that the Bose line and Sony XM line are pretty great. The sound core q30s also have decent reviews for the price.

You have to understand an audiophile sits down and listens to music at a chair, in their home, where it’s quiet. They don’t give a shit how a headphone looks. They want all the money to go to sound quality and durability. It’s hard to compare an audiophile pair of cans to something that’s portable. Where you might benefit from Bluetooth, ANC, and portability. I used to walk around when I was in college with my sennheisers but that 1) looked really stupid 2) were a pain to take around 3) couldn’t put the volume up too much because they were open back headphones.

Personally, If I’m traveling I use a pair of Koss Porta Pros or my galaxy buds and I’ve been seriously considering a pair of the XM4s for the plane. I just did a long flight sitting next to the wings and I don’t think I can do that again. Had to blast my earbuds which is super annoying.

If you’re interested in the audiophile space and understand the limitations of a pair of headphones for that domain buy a pair of KSC 75s (<$20-extremely portable, open ended), or a Phillips SHP 9500 ($70-less portable, open ended).

Your headphones will last forever, if you use them with care, and you can just replace the dac if the battery wears out over the years. 


This is cheaper and sounds much better. You will miss out on noise cancelling though.

If the batteries are of good quality they won't really just stop working, you will just get less and less listening time out of them as time goes on. Additionally some have batteries that are pretty easy to replace if you're ok with cracking them open. This includes the XM5 and you can get a replacement battery on Amazon for like $30 CAD upon a quick google search.

Also for this specific model you can largely ignore people saying that wireless headphones are ""disposable"". While they're not designed to be user serviceable it's entirely possible to replace the battery yourself in the future if you are willing to roll up your sleeves a bit. See my [comment above](https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1bsubco/comment/kxl6af7/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

Technology wise things may improve with future models like the ANC, feature, etc so these types of headphones can go ""outdated"" in that sense but they won't stop being what they are currently. Don't let FOMO convince to upgrade and just toss away perfectly good headphones.",guesswhochickenpoo,2

I think these headphones are fantastic and I will not even consider the XM6 when it comes out as the XM5 is so good, that I literally do not see a need or desire to upgrade when the time comes. With proper care and no undue force when putting on and removing them, they should last a long time and as far as the sound is concerned, I just love em. They may not be everyone's cup of tea but they sure are mine!

Something often missing around here (understandably so).

That said:

>a ton of bass **and treble** and scooped upper mids which made them very easy to listen to but not neutral. But they were also loud, **clear**, and had stronger dynamics. The XM5's have a little more midrange focus and clarity, not as much **sparkly treble boost**,

A ton of bass, sure, the XM4's are bass cannons. Perhaps it's just me, but I've never seen anyone describe them as having a ton of treble or having a sparkly treble boost either. In fact, the opposite is usually what I'd see (recessed treble), and I'd also have to say that my XM4's, without EQ, are super lacking in treble and ""sparkle.""

This is important because, if what you say is true, the XM5 have even less treble than the XM4, which already imo sorely lacks in that department. I honestly hope this isn't the case, but if it is, I'd find the XM5's to be hugely disappointing even if the bass was reduced and other aspects were improved.",p_pal2000,4

It's above the upper mids and the 3-4k harshness area, and it's below the ""air"" range of 10k plus. It comes across as sparkle, or if you had a warm pair of headphones and boosted the 6-8k range kind of narrowly. That doesn't make them detailed or airy though.

I think if you look at Soundguys' curve, that's not far off. There's less of the treble sparkle and overall it sounds a little more like Harman, although a little more boosted in the low mids and bass.

I'll listen tonight against my K371 to see how that compares...vs the HD6xx it definitely seemed like there was more low mids and bass and less clarity in the highs, but it wasn't unpleasant.

As can be seen in the suggestions, the ""base sound"" has a little bit more treble, a bit less bass and is weaker in the mid/higher mid range. It's a very balanced sound imho for more quiet music, though lacking a little bit in presence, while the original XM4 sound was just muffled imho. Lacks a little bit of punch initially though. I find them much more round in comparison with or without EQ, goes a bit more into the Sennheiser Momentum direction now. The biggest difference for me is that the bass seems way more integrated in the soundstage now. I'd never upgrade them only for the sound though, the ANC is the biggest difference in direct comparison. Regarding comfort I'm still not so sure and need more time with them. Bit more side pressure and more sound isolation (which also means they feel hotter) could make them less comfortable, on the other hand there's a bit more space for the ears.

I have noticed that the XM5s' have far more variability with the ANC than the XM4s'. Putting the headband farther down my head is the difference between hearing my mouse clicking and near-dead silence. Similarly, this may differ depending on your head shape. 

Fortunately, the XM5s' are light enough that even putting them in an otherwise awkward location for comfort and ANC quality is fairly trivial. 

After they're adjusted properly though, I find ANC is far superior to the XM4s' in terms of low and mid cancellation, and cabin pressure. 

In fact, on the XM5s', I actually can't feel any ANC cabin pressure at all, which was my most immediate observation. Although, after 8 hours sitting with ANC on and a fan blasting to the right of me, I have occasionally found my right ear in mysterious pain. I'd imagine this is the result of prolonged exposure to attempted cancellation of >\~18khz. If you're over 25, this is probably a non-issue.",CHduckie,1

I'll need to play around with EQ and see how that goes too.

I wonder sometimes when people are talking about lack of treble they may actually be talking about a lack of upper mids, lower down in the frequency range. Often the same frequency range can be described as ""upper mids"" by one but ""treble"" by another. I don't have the XM4 overears, but I do have the XM4 TWS and their issue with sounding muted or muffled is more about too recessed upper mids (as in, inadequate pinna gain- the 3Khz bump) IMO than lack of treble.

It's the 1.5-4kHz range that is most consistently recessed. Although of course with that massive bass boost I guess that is going to recess everything else, relatively.

Both the XM4 and XM5 have toggle switches for ANC, so depending on how they are set up in the store, it's possible the ANC was turned on or off, or the transparency mode was on or off. Also, there's like 20 different transparency settings, so if the setting was changed, it could allow some sound from the mics to bleed through.

Also, there's this adaptive setting that will automatically turn ANC on or off or transparency up and down. I disable that because I want to control it.

Anyways, I just dragged the XM4, XM5, and APM all into the same room (like mid comment I stopped and did this). I listened to all three with my air purifier fan on max. XM5 basically eliminated the noise, APM you could hear it more clearly, and XM4 was worse than the other two. Then I went into the bathroom and turned on a faucet. All three took some of the high end noise out but you could still hear some whooshing, but the XM5 was about half as loud as the XM4 and APM.

Noise cancelling works great.  
>  
>(...)

What about the background noise on the mic though? I'd like to confirm there is no misunderstanding here. Noise cancelling may be working great indeed, but only for you - meaning on the headphones but not the mic.

The effect is so that you (the one wearing ANC headphones) does not hear the background noise at all. However the other people on the call hear it a lot. I had this a lot with the WH-1000XM3. Like i.e. people on a call with me could not hear me well but heard a lot my wife who was talking over a phone next to me. What makes it even worse, I was unaware as for me the headphones ANC kept my wife's voice barely noticeable.

So have you ever tried actually this on the XM5s: that there is a lot of noise near you (ideally including other people talking) and whoever is on the other side of the call, remains undisturbed with this background noise on your side?

As for the fact the noise is cancelled well for you, there is no doubt about this. This works well even with the XM3s.

There are extra factors here to consider. Like MS Teams has built-in software layer of input noise cancelling (from the mic). So to properly conduct Sony's mic noise cancelling test, ideally that should be disabled in the MS Teams Device Settings.

Given how crappy this is on the XM3s, I am quite sceptical about XM5s mic noise cancelling too. Also because most of the opinions/reviews conflate these two - headphones vs mic noise cancelling. Sometimes a reviewer may simply remain unaware, as I was myself for quite a bit.

1. you need to actually have a significant background noise
2. be one the call at the same time
3. have the person/people you talk to asked about how much noise from your side they can hear

Not many reviews are conducted with all of the points at once. Also many people, who you talk to on daily basis (Teams calls, etc.) would not complain about the noise coming from your side until you ask them about it. Or they will complain only when the noise really is to the level of a nuisance.

In other words, are you certain the noise cancelling on the XM5s works well or you just haven't fully checked it? As not fully checking by any of the below:

* there is not much noise around, like no one else talking in the same room, when you are on calls
* you haven't asked your team about the background noise in particular, but only how well they can hear you
* software noise cancelling did the job (Mac's built-in or MS Teams, or whatever you could use with such capabilities)

With XM3s I've ended up connecting extra boom mic and using dedicated noise cancelling software to have the proper level of noise cancelling on the mic. I am yet to find a headset on the market which would combine both: good noise cancelling on my ears and on my mic. Before I throw hefty sum on the XM5, would be good to know does it actually do it.",tamashumi,1

First, there aren't too many physical shops that stock a large number of high end headphones. Second, you really want to try them out with a range of music that you listen to, so it takes some time. Third, the store environment may be different from where you'll be using them, so especially for open back headphones, the ambient sound makes a lot of difference. Fourth, you want to try them out with your setup (source/DAC/amp) which is different from the store setup.

So you need to figure a few things out:

1. Budget
2. Open or closed back
3. Driver type (planar magnetic or dynamic or electrostatic)
4. Desired sound signature

The sound signature you'll want for mastering/producing (neutral) will be different from what you might want for different kinds of music or for gaming. Also, you need to decide if you're ok with eq-ing or not.

One other thing to think about is that while sound signature is really important, don't discount comfort as a factor. Headphone weight, clamping force, earcup shape, etc. make a huge difference in your enjoyment and whether you're ok with having them on your head for hours at a time.",grendelone,3

Most people just have experience with closed back headphones, so open back headphones where you can hear everything around you as if you weren't wearing headphones is an unusual experience. Open backs generally give the widest sound stage and have an easier time with detail since they don't have to deal with reflections off of the closed back. If you will be using them in a quiet environment, open back are generally better. But if you're in an office environment, on the go, or otherwise in a noisy environment, then you'll want closed back.

  
Most headphones are dynamic. Planar magnetics are more rare and known for their ""fast"" response. Electrostatic are very rare and generally expensive.

  
You can learn a lot about your own preferences by just eq-ing a pair of headphones that you have (or the XM5's). You can tune them for a warm signature (suppress treble, boost bass), neutral (follow Harmon curve), V-shaped (boost treble and bass), etc. But if you go down this rathole, expect to sometimes get some headphones that you eventually want to sell (don't like sound or upgrade). That's why sites like headfi have such an active buy/sell forum.

  
There are some good sites for ""budget"" audiophile recommendations. A lot of people like Zeos. While his recommendations are usually good, his review style is a bit long winded to me and the anime girls stuff is cringey. InnerFidelity was good before they were bought out and the original author retired. But they still have a lot of good informative articles etc. Crinacle is good for IEM stuff, but that's a whole different rathole.

  
For places to start looking for stuff to buy, generally the Drop related stuff is decent as are some of Monoprice's headphones.",grendelone,2

I love the ANC of course, but at home I just want to hear what's going on around me in case my phone / doorbell rings or something else happens.

Personally I absolutely swear by the AirPods Pro 2 but from everything I've heard about the Max, it's overhyped and overpriced. I may reevaluate when the Max 2 comes out but I sort of lost interest when they were marked up by $95 in Canada, and then I started hearing more about them and permanently lost interest. I like that the Sonys are USB C, and work in wired mode without needing to be powered. I like all the extra configuration in the app, particularly the equalizer—I customized mine a lot and am very happy with how it sounds.

Sony has been Bose's nightmare since the year 2016 when they introduced the MDR-1000x. Until then, Bose had a stranglehold on the ANC headphone market since no other headphone was quite as effective at cancelling noise. Fast forward to now and Bose has been losing more and more to Sony with every new iteration of the WH or WF series. Apple joined the ANC headphone market in the year 2020 with the AirPods Max and those have been my go-to in this category.  
  
The XM5s are bit controversial in terms of storage and travel due to their inability to collapse and fold into a small form factor similar to the previous Sony WH series. Sony likely took this new design route to remove the weakest point in a headphone. There were numerous complaints of previous WH iterations cracking at the point where the headband folds so hopefully this new design choice is more durable. The Bose NC 700 and AirPods Max also adopt this design where there is no folding.  
  
The feel and build quality of the XM5s is no match for the AirPods Max, but the XM5s is not cheap. However, this much lighter design thanks to the materials chosen results in supreme comfort whereas the AirPods Max shows its weight after an hour or two on my head. The AirPods Max feel like their price tag although it doesn’t translate too well in terms of listening comfort for some users. Definitely recommend testing headphones out at your local electronics store if possible. Comfort can make or break them.  
  
The case is much better on the XM5s in comparison to the AirPods Max. They completely cover the headphone and also have a compartment to hold the 3.5mm analog cable as well as the USB-C cable. The AirPods Max case on the other hand has no compartment to hold extra cables and leaves the headband exposed to scratches and tears if you throw them in a busy bag. The AirPods Max case is literally really only useful to power off the headphones.  
  
Battery life is superb on the XM5s at 30 hours or 40 hours with no ANC/Transparency activated. You can also get 3 hours of charge in 3 minutes if using a USB-C PD equipped power adapter. Insane! The AirPods Max has a 20-hour battery life which is inferior to the XM5s on paper but still more than enough for me since all I needed was 8-10 hours of run time to get me through the office for the day. The XM5s charge via the more standard and easily accessible USB-C connection while the AirPods Max uses a lightning connection which might not be an issue if you have an iPhone since that is what is needed to charge that as well. The XM5s can also operate passively from the 3.5mm analog port using the included cable in the event the battery completely dies. Do keep in mind, the sound will not be as good as when it is powered due to the electronics not actively EQ’ing out the deficiencies of the driver. The AirPods Max do not operate at all when their power is depleted. Neither support USB-DAC audio.  
  
App support is a landslide victory to the XM5s with the ability to manually update the headphone, adjust EQ, set listening modes based on activity or location, view listening habits, adjust playback and ambient mode controls, etc. It’s an extensive list of customizations that the XM5s allows. The AirPods Max on the other hand are only really customizable on an iOS device through the Bluetooth settings and even then, there’s far less customization. So, while the XM5s work well with both iOS and Android, the AirPods Max is only worth considering if you have an iPhone.  
  
ANC performance between the two are both excellent and you can’t go wrong with either. It’s like picking hairs trying to find a winner here. Sometimes I feel like the AirPods Max blocks out more noise (particularly in the lower frequencies) and sometimes I think it’s the XM5s that win (particularly in the higher frequencies). It really depends on the environment but I will confidently say these are the best two ANC headphones on the market. Moving over to transparency mode and I find that the AirPods Max slightly edges the XM5s in the sense of naturalness to the sound. It simply sounds more like I don’t have a headphone on my head with the AirPods Max more so than the XM5s which sound a tad bit processed. I can still however, easily hold conversations on my XM5s transparency mode with my co-workers at work or hear announcements on the train platforms.  
  
Call quality between the two is also excellent but the XM5s edge out the AirPods Max in the ability to literally make you sound like you’re in a quiet room despite there being wind or noises in the background. So, while both headphones pick up your voice clearly, the XM5s blocks out background noises better. It’s honestly amazing because the previous Sony WH iterations were mediocre in terms of microphone performance but now Sony is the king in this department. Great job!  
  
Lastly, the sound. I love em’ both. I would describe the XM5s as warm. There’s less emphasis in the treble and particularly the upper treble in comparison to the AirPods Max. The XM5s midrange also has more fullness to it which makes the overall sound more in your face and vivid. This is great to reduce listening fatigue over time but sometimes can hurt the clarity of the mix. Thankfully, the XM5 has the ability to EQ the tuning using its app. The XM5s bass is much, much improved over the XM4 and now sounds very tactile, precise and still full of oomph and power. The AirPods Max bass is more emphasized in the sub bass, with a flatter and more neutral mid to upper bass response and also has a precise and tactile sounding bass profile. The XM5s bass is more mid-bass focused so you get more of that punchy feel. Personally, I prefer a sub bass boost, with flatter mid-bass and upper bass to prevent blooming into the midrange. Soundstage between the two is great but the AirPods Max sounds a bit airier and spacious even after EQ'ing the XM5s. Details and subtle nuances sound a tad easier to hear on the AirPods Max as a result as well. The XM5 is still no slouch and music sound very detailed and clear despite the warmer turning which just shows how well controlled the XM5s speaker is in its transient response. So, while the AirPods Max is the more neutral and slightly clearer sounding option, the XM5s is the more punchy and smooth option. The XM5s max volume is louder than AirPods Max and neither of them distort near or at their max volume which is a major issue I have with Bose headphones and earphones. All in all, I can live with either the AirPods Max or XM5 in terms of sound, but if I had to choose, my preference is the AirPods Max because I tend to prefer a more accurate and spacious sound. Like stated before, the XM5 can be EQ'd to sound neutral but the soundstage still lacks a bit to the AirPods Max. Soundstage can't be EQ'd since it's an inherent part of the physical speaker design. A quick mention is that I find that the XM4 sounds overly bright and boomy in comparison to the AirPods Max or XM5 even after endless attempts of trying to EQ them using the app. Sony really improved the quality of sound on the XM5 and they are the best sounding yet in the WH lineup.  
  
In conclusion, the AirPods Max and Sony XM5 are at the top. It really boils down to this despite the differences between the two... If you have an iPhone, get the AirPods Max. If you have an Android phone, get the Sony XM5s.",Protomize,324

I have the XM2’s and looking to upgrade at this point (or maybe keep if my wife will use it on long flights) and got both the XM5’s and APM to try with the intention of keeping one. I use Apple devices (iPhone, iPad, Mac).

Biggest issue I had with the XM2’s were comfort as the headband creates a pressure point on the top of my head and that ANC isn’t quite as top notch as the best of the best these days and has a very slight hissing sound, though basically disappears or imperceptible once music is played at sufficient volume. However sound quality wise I love the XM2’s. They are detailed and well balanced with good oomph in the bass that’s well controlled. I never understood how all the “professional reviews” thought the XM4’s sounded great because to me they sound bloated and muddy. Funny how some reviewers are only acknowledging this now in their XM5 reviews now that the new model is out.

The XM5’s do sound much better than the XM4’s with way tighter bass and less bloat. Also more comfortable, with better mics. However with default EQ they still sound a little bloated but do clean up decently with a bit of adjustment in the app and so props to Sony for the good EQ. They are also much more comfortable than the XM2’s but still create a bit of a pressure point in the headband. The ear cups and clamping is perfect though. The APM clamp harder, but the mesh headband system distributes the weight much better with no pressure so for me the APM wins on comfort. I can see how others may find the XM5 more comfortable however if they don’t have the pressure point issue. 

Sony’s ANC on the XM5 is amazing. I feel it is the best of any I’ve heard and slightly better than the APM. I feel they passively block a bit more than the APM and maybe that’s why they’re top. APM is pretty close though and neither creates cabin pressure for me. Also echo your points on mic call quality, case, battery life etc which the XM5’s win out on.

Sound wise however I think the APM are pretty incredible. The soundstage and airiness is very impressive for Bluetooth closed back headphones and much better than the XM5’s. The latter EQ nicely and can sound very good but they still can’t replicate what the APM’s do. Genuinely impressed how lively everything sounds on these, detailed and spacious.

One other thing that’s worth mentioning is given these all have a finite life due to battery degradation over time, the APM’s can have the battery replaced for $79 at Apple. As far as I know Sony don’t offer battery replacement but someone can correct me if that’s not right. Otherwise you will have to go the DIY route which frankly I wouldn’t do and reckon many others won’t either.

Lastly the APM work great with the H1 chip and the auto switching and spatial audio feature if you use Apple devices.

I’m leaning towards keeping the APM and sending back the XM5’s but will keep testing them out for another week to be sure.

TLDR: Agee pretty much fully with your review having tried both headphones. Trying to decide which to keep but given I use Apple devices and think the APM sound a little better leaning towards those. The XM5’s are excellent though and can’t go wrong with them either.",sft007,3

The MX5 has a 3.5mm jack and can play CD or close to CD quality. I know Apple has redefined compression to be an art form, to the point where you’ll never know the difference. However if I’m taking the time to rip CD’s and pay for high quality, I’d like to play it. Weight was a huge factor for me, huge! Apple has always defined premium by weight and I’ve learned in the headphone space that doesn’t translate. The MX5 is air and the fact that they can do that and get that sound should let anyone know how beautiful crafted and engineered those cans are. I do like the AP Max sound signature a tad better but comfort trumps that to the ground. If they ever make an APMax that’s light weight and sounds like that it’s game over for all other ANC headphones.",chum_slice,4

They definitely deliver on sound signature, but I'm really considering returning them. It's the goddamn *headband.* It may not seem like they took much padding out of it, but for some reason, it causes me so much pressure on the top of my head. I notice it within minutes and within an hour I'm actively uncomfortable wearing them. I've tried adjusting the fit every which way but nothing works.

I’m quite curious about instrument separation and how the AirPods Max and the WH XM5s compare. 

I do agree that the AirPods Max is more neutral, with more detail, better-controlled bass, and a much wider soundstage compared to the Sony WH XM4s. However I felt that the Sony had better instrument separation and placement, whereas instrument lines blend together on the AirPods Max (despite the extra detail) that it created a left and right wall of sound effect. I imagine the WH XM5 should do better than, if not as good as, the WH XM4 on instrument separation. Could you comment on that?

Obviously it is not fair to compare earbuds to headphones, but I thought the Sony WF XM4 earbuds had a similar tonal response to the AirPods Max, far better than the WH XM4. Still, I found that the Sony WF XM4 earbuds had far more detail and shockingly far better instrument separation than either headphone, with the bass quality of the AirPods Max - sub-bass emphasis, tactile, fast and well-defined.",boildler,1

I'm not sure what it's like in other countries, but here in New Zealand the ""Quick Access"" feature - which lets you press the \[NC/AMB\] button either 2 or 3 times for quick access to an app - supports ONLY ONE application: Spotify.

There is no ability to set anything to the quick access double tap. Only Spotify.

Historically Sony also lowers their price after a while if you can wait a year or so. TBH i’d put it this way if you use sony. 

MX3 
Pros more codecs and some audio effects

XM4
multi device paring, loses codecs and some of the effects.

Xm5 - new style, and better calls. 

XM5 has the best anc but not to the degree i’d make a purchase decision it.  IMO try to get xm4 on sale, like 200 or so. (it’s been there before and about what i paid). If you need calls wait for xm5 after price drops. (if you are price sensitive like me).

IMO the Apple one is fine if you can tolerate the apple “Controls” and the price. I’ve not entirely convinced its’ justified. I think most people will reach for the sony as well due to weight and versitility, that’s just a hunch though. 

THE TLDR for me is both APPLE (especially) and Sony to some degree have over priced  these. Time will tell. Bose is still the most comfortable, makes great calls and I feel the anc is pretty close, it does with things a little differently. The sound signature to me is not as much to my liking. I like sony the best (but i mean that just an opinion but what made the choice for me) well and cost.",brandyleeloo,1

I managed to get them for 400 brand new open box at Best Buy it kind of hurt considering how much of a discount I got. But I found the xm5s on eBay from a reputable refurbished seller for 260 so that’s why I have the xm5s. I do miss the wider sound stage from the APM and definitely the low profile with the great build quality. I do think the APM were a little more comfortable due to the headband being wider so didn’t create a pressure point unlike the Sony’s but so far I’ve got used to it so it’s not as bad and definitely can wear my Sony’s for a lot longer after just 3 days of using them. Really liking the xm5s rn especially with the eq! In my opinion if the APM were around 300 I would honestly had kept them. Just the build quality and the wider sound stage I kind of miss. But overall not disappointed with my xm5s at all! The eq settings definitely make it better and I do think the ANC is much better! I’ll definitely be buying the next generation APM tho and hopefully they fix the main problems like a usb c charging, power button (definitely sucked not being able to fully turn them off), maybe a 3.5 mm jack or atleast a connection to use when dead, and probably the biggest one is adding a new codec for sound as well as eq that would definitely seal the deal for me but one can only dream:)",devintejeda1234,1

It’s not night in day. Sound is subjective though. I’ll leave it to you to sort say what you like better. The new ones are a little more detailed. The anc is a little better. 

The big benefit to me is the call quality is finally good. 

If you don’t need that i’d listen to both (amazon and return if ya don’t like it). At sale time you can get the xm4 for 170.  I paid i beleve about that price on some verizon deal a couple years ago. I have my mx4 for work, and use my xm3 at home and work out with them. 

Both are bullet proof. I still use the mx3 every day for hours and sleep in them. Changed the battery twice. IF you asked me what i would do the difference is only 50 and you are paying full retail i’d get the new ones. But i wouldn’t do that. I’d wait for a steep discount.

The WH-1000XM5… was a little underwhelming. Tonality wise, I felt that Sony really tried to move towards the sound of the AirPods Max. The bass was punchy, aggressive, and mid-bass focused as you said! It was deeper and tighter than that of the WH XM5, but still not quite as deep or well-defined as the bass on the AirPods Max (or Sony’s own WF XM4 earbuds - not a fair comparison, but still.) I also thought that the XM5 bass was a little disjointed from the rest of the sound.

One of my favorite parts about the WH XM4 sound is its upper midrange boost and treble presence, even if it isn’t terribly detailed. The WH XM5 does away with the lower treble, but more severely the upper treble. It almost felt like hearing loss. I did not like the APM’s de-emphasis of upper mids and lower treble, and I didn’t think this was any better.

I thought the technical ability of the WH XM5 is on about the same level as the APM or the WH XM4, with the APM having the most spacious soundstage and macrodetail, and the XM5 with the best instrument separation (still mediocre). APM and WH XM5 tied for transient response. Not sure about dynamics.

I’m a Sony fan, but I will have to say that the WH-1000XM5 is a miss. For now, I’d still reach for my WF-1000XM4 earbuds for good sound in a wireless package + NC.

With that said, I read your sound quality again, I find it to be very much agreeable especially when doing comparisons. Thanks for the review!",boildler,2

However...there aren't really any nouns ending with S that you would pluralise. You wouldn't say 'Physicses' because having multiple physics isnt really thing; you wouldn't say 'molasseses' because molasses is plural in nature as it describes a liquid substance.

When it comes to model names then, my (brief) research into this indicates that you'd treat them like human names - so many people called Chris would be multiple Chris's; but something belonging to Chris would be 'Chris' headphones'.

Confusingly, you could would also use 's on a name as a contraction of 'is' - so 'Chris is coming' would be 'Chris's coming' - although generally contractions are avoided when names end with an S.

Not sure I agree with you on the comment about rules - language \*does\* work that way precisely because of the rules put in place. The rules exist to prevent confusion - although ironically (and clearly evident by this discussion) they can cause more problems than they solve.

the whole purpose of language is to facilitate the communication of ideas. if the person you’re talking to understands what you meant them to, you’re never wrong. and if you departed from established convention to make your point clearer, rather than “breaking rules” it would be more apt to say you’ve “transcended convention”.",blastfromtheblue,1

I love the enhanced sub-bass you can dial up..    I added about +2 on the high treble side and that evened it out for me.    Sony's stock sound signature is always on the warm side.    If you're looking for probably the newest, lightest on-ear BT headphones, these are it..  Comfort isn't amazing but it's better than most around this price point.     These do go on sale for 39.99 in the states (they have twice so far) so if you can score that deal - it's a no brainer.     A tough decision for me was that the JBL BT510's are on sale for 29.99 right now but they are a bit long in the tooth (a few years old) without as many features as the new CH520s.    The EQ feature is a big win for the CH520 since the CH510s didn't have it.   Personally I was thinking the no-passive option was kind of a dealbreaker, these having over 50+ hours of battery life kind of makes you never have battery anxiety.   Back to sound quality my only gripe is that the stereo separation/sound stage is pretty flat and very inside your head but I guess that's to be expected at this price point.",Good_Honest_Jay,2

They seem pretty good to me, surprisingly for the price. I'm also kind of curious to see how the 720's sound as well.

One thing that really bugs me with several of the current high end ANC headphones is you can't shut off the ANC. That's the case with the Bose QC45 and the Sennheiser Momentum 4. Then others like AirPods Max you can't adjust it so it's either way too high or you get a lot of rumbling.

So it's nice to have the option of the 520's where it's light and fairly comfortable and sounds pretty good for both voice and music. And being only $60 and having long battery life is a huge plus. Also, having USB-C charging and EQ! Great features.",JarickL,2

Just overall I do not regret my purchase and I consider the most important point, which is to get headphones as soon as they are released because afterwards there will be many customer returns, defectives and secondhand scam even from official stores.

Previously, I was using the cheap JLab Rewind on ears that are about $20. Those were surprisingly nice in the ""bass boost"" setting for listening to podcasts without blocking sound.

It's surprisingly quite good!

I took a couple of work calls from them (Zoom, Teams). I can hear everyone crystal clear which is great. Sometimes really colored headphones result in muffled or tinny voices. These sound very good.

Took myself off of mute in a couple calls and everyone could hear me just fine, no complaints. I didn't ask about the quality or anything as they're big calls with a lot of people on them.

Then I just did a voice memo on my iPhone which I've taken with I think about every headphone I've used. Again, they're quite good which is unexpected! My voice sounds pretty clear, a little rolled off in the lows but not tinny.

Now it does sound like there's a noise gate so when I'm not speaking with a medium to loud voice it kind of cuts out a bit which is annoying.

To be clear it's not nearly as clear as the Bose 700 which are the best I've used. Or the Airpod Pros which are also fantastic. And they're probably a bit worse than the Sony XM4 and Airpod Max and others. I bet if you got into a noisy environment things would probably get worse too.

I got the option for a refund, so I thought I'd get the Q45s for an ""upgrade"".

I got them some hours ago. I'm extremely disappointed so far. In my usual setting (at home), the ANC is worse than normal mode. I can hear a hissing when it's on. Sound quality also seems to be way worse. I'm waiting for them to charge a bit and then I'll update them and try again

Multipoint seems to be also worse than with my Q30. Pairing/connecting takes like 5x as much, and for a moment I wasn't able to enable media playback on my android phone, even after disconnecting them from my PC and even forgetting the device and pairing again.

Something else I noticed with the ANC is that it's slower to respond, and I can hear some weird sudden volume changes. That might be related to some new settings that weren't present on the Q30.

I really hope something improves after some tweaking, but I'm 99% sure I'll return them and either get new Q30s or something else. Q30s were fine... cheap material quality, but for the price I guess it's reasonable.

The only improvements I noticed from the Q30s are:

-They're a bit more comfortable

-The announcer woman voice doesn't pause playback every time it sounds.

  
UPDATE: I've just updated the Q45s to the last firmware version, and even enabled LDAC and played a lot with the EQ settings. No chance. I can't understand how could anyone find them better sounding than the Q30s. It's not only the lack of bass, but the overall definition in all frequencies. And the ANC... it might work better in other louder settings which I didn't try, but it's insane that they actually produce noise when the room is already silent. With the Q30s, ANC is more silent than Normal mode, always.",_cyb3r_,1

Lithium-ion battery failures are nothing new and everyone should be aware that they can happen. There's plenty of videos of exploding vapes, e-scooters, etc. They are rare, but they do happen. They're more likely to happen with very cheap products or with very cheap chargers (the chargers are a bit less likely because a good product should have over voltage and over current protection...or at least over current. These can happen from physical damage, shorts, manufacturing defects, water damage, etc.

Keep in-mind that the vast majority of consumer electronics with lithium ion batteries have off-the-shelf batteries that are not made by the brand of the actual device.

No brand is immune to this. Again, you don't typically need to worry, especially when buying decent-quality electronics, but everyone should be aware that this can happen.

Most electronics like this will use off-the-shelf batteries because these brands are not also battery manufacturers, so you might buy some other brand and get the exact same battery that was in this particular unit.

It looks like the 1st batch had an issue with Samsung's own battery design (so that's more of a design testing failure than a QC failure, but also would fall to the realm of QC once the issue was discovered post-launch). The 2nd round of issues appears to be from the 2nd battery vendor Samsung used, who had manufacturing defects which they claim was from trying to ramp up production so quickly. That's definitely a QC failure, though that QC would fall more to the battery vendor than Samsung. Apparently that vendor was also used for iPhones (not sure which models exactly).

The Note 7 is an interesting example for sure, as it seems like there were multiple semi-unrelated failures and by the time they could've been addressed, public opinion was so low that it made more financial sense to EOL the product.",AudioMan612,4

I don't blame anyone for not wanting to be a guinea pig and preferring to play it safe, and I definitely wouldn't encourage anyone to ignore something like this, but it would be more prudent to research if there is a significant number of cases.

The brand I work for has had this happen on extremely rare occasion. Of the millions of units sold in the 5 years I have worked at my current job, I have seen less than I can count on 1 hand. Any decent brand will treat issues like this extremely seriously (as did we).

One other variable is using good quality chargers. Sure, a good product should still have good protection circuits to help deal with dangerous issues, but man, some of those off-brand USB chargers out there are absolute trash that shouldn't be allowed on the market. Save a few bucks here, but likely reduce your battery capacity faster.

As far as ""due diligence in sourcing batteries"" goes, how do you know they didn't (they more than likely did)? And we don't even know if the battery was the root cause, or another component failure leading to the battery going into thermal runaway. Perhaps Anker cheaped-out on protection circuitry, which would absolutely be on them, but perhaps this 1 unit got a bad power component (which again, more than likely not made by Anker). Or, perhaps the battery had been bulging for a while, but OP hadn't noticed it, and this was the outcome. There isn't a major expensive brand out there where you can't find plenty of cases of bulging batteries. Sony, Apple, whatever. There's just too many variables to conclude that Soundcore products have a higher chance of catastrophic battery failure than other brands from 1 Reddit post. As you pointed out, Anker is known for their high-quality battery packs, and they didn't get that reputation by having a bunch of fires and explosions (though they likely have completely different teams working on their audio products and there's a good chance they are using completely different battery vendors).

I don't blame you for not wanting to use Anker headphones. I don't work for them, but even if I did, I wouldn't care. I understand the feeling. I'm just trying to say that as someone who works in product development in consumer electronics, this 1 case on its own doesn't mean very much.",AudioMan612,20

If you're looking for some good ANC over-ear headphones, you might want to check out Sony. Both the WH-1000XM4 and WH-1000XM5 are on-sale right now. There are few products that compete at that level.",AudioMan612,1

The W600BT and WH700NB seem really good based on the Amazon reviews. Just trying to decide if the ANC is worth the extra weight.,Eclectic_Lynx,1
soundcore space q45,headphones,My Soundcore Q45 melted,17s0z3a,quincy-,https://i.redd.it/lbfa1f2rwhzb1.jpg,932,165,1700813566,"> WH700NB

The difference in weight is likely more from the larger battery in the WH700NB. ANC uses a fair amount of power, and even with ANC on, the WH700NB has substantially better battery life. That difference is likely at least partially due to a larger battery (though it possible that the WH700NB just has a more efficient chipset; just less likely).

Weight alone doesn't tell you much.There are other variables that come into play, especially how good the headband distributes the weight. For example, if the headband stretches in a way that only a tiny spot in the middle actually makes contact with your head, then you'll experience a pressure point. My primary headphones ([Dan Clark Ether Flow 1.1](https://danclarkaudio.com/catalog/product/view/_ignore_category/1/id/30/s/ether-flow/)) are much heavier than both of these headphones, and are insanely comfortable no matter how long I wear them. My old [Sennheiser HD 700](https://global.sennheiser-hearing.com/products/hd-700)'s are a similar weight and even more comfortable. My [Audeze LCD-X](https://www.audeze.com/products/lcd-x) however...not the most comfortable due to weight lol.

A few other variables relating to comfort are clamping force, materials, and the form factor (open-back vs closed-back, though you won't find open-back ANC headphones lol).

Also, the WH700NB appear to have metal sliders while the W600BT has plastic ones. That has the potential for considerably better durability (we are talking very cheap products in this product class at this point, so don't expect amazing build quality).

ANC is a pretty major feature, especially if you have use for it. You can always turn it off when you don't want it.

There is one advantage to the W600BT: it supports a wired 3.5mm connection if this is important to you.",AudioMan612,1

They have a pretty v-shaped sound profile with extra thump, rumble, and boom, as well as bright and sparkly sibilants. However, they also have a peak in their high-mid, which makes vocals and instruments sound harsh, while the dip in the low-treble veils their details.

> The Anker Soundcore Space Q45 sound quality is probably the headset’s biggest issue. It’s not all terrible, most users will get used to the headset’s sound after a few minutes of use, but it doesn’t hold up next to other options on the market. The frequency response curve deviates noticeably from our ideal target curve across all areas of the frequency spectrum. The sub-bass is slightly exaggerated, the midrange depressed slightly, and the higher frequencies are besieged by an undulating change in response that causes high-end elements in music to sound hissy, betraying the accuracy of the playback.",guesswhochickenpoo,3

But a lot of perceived bass slam and impact actually comes from the treble, and the ratio of the bass to the midrange ""meat"" of the music can also disproportionately affect bass quantity perception.

After adding 5 dB centered at 100 Hz, I'd try raising the upper treble frequencies past 10 kHz or so by 5 dB. If I couldn't use a high shelf and needed to pick a frequency to center the boost at with a bell-shaped filter, I'd specifically pick 16 kHz. If that's not enough, I would try either decreasing 500 Hz or 1000 Hz by 3-5 dB, depending on whether I wanted a V-shaped or a U-shaped sound signature.

Try installing PowerAmp EQ if the Soundcore app doesn't allow for that level of fine-tuning. Parametric mode has a steeper learning curve than graphical but will give you better results if the latter doesn't work well for you. If you use parametric EQ, you'll want to use a low shelf for the bass, a high shelf for the treble, and bell filters for the midrange.",dongas420,1

And after 4 hours, I've resorted to just placing them on top of the flap of my ear just to keep them from causing pain.

My C2 Wireless started having issues where it would just slowly drop volume until it reset, and Scroll Wheel issues, and replaceable ear pads torn up, but so far it just seems like a better set due to how uncomfortable the Nova Pro Wireless is. Just cut out the padding on them and put them between the normal pad and the giant spears stabbing my ear, and it's slightly better so far. Obviously more muffled sound.

Edit: Day 2. After messing with sizing, and location, I've managed to get a bit of it to reside with 5x the padding inside the cup than sent normally with the headset. Still hurts after about 1 hour, though.

The Astros are a lot more comfortable because the Nova Wireless has a mic that sticks out of the ear cup and touches your ear. 

The Astros also have a lower latency which is important to me as a streamer. 

The sound quality is very close. The Astros have more bass and the SteelSeries has better mids/Highs. For listening to footsteps the SteelSeries are slightly better because footsteps are a high frequency noise. However it isn't good enough to overlook it's other flaws.

The software of the Astro is much better and fine-tuned. The Steelseries software is buggy and wouldn't detect the headset half the time. 

I thought about buying the Nova Pro Wired because it would fix the two issues I have with the wireless version but then I would be giving up the wireless functionality. End the end I'm sticking with the Astros. Astro should be releasing the Gen5 this year hopefully and I will make the jump to those.",SSGSS_Bender,1

I had the ps5 one. They do have clear and accurate audio. Frequencies are pretty good 

But they lack punch to it and they are probably one of the most uncomfortable headphones because of the ski band top and the shallow ear cups

The main problem seems to be the Frequency Response Consistency category, where it is noted "" The SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro have disappointing frequency response consistency. They're very prone to inconsistencies in bass and treble delivery due to fit, positioning, and seal. You may especially notice a drop in bass if you have thick hair or wear glasses, as this can break the ear cup's seal. ""  Where as the A50s "" These headphones have great frequency response consistency. This means that they deliver audio relatively similarly across different users and between reseats. ""

So it looks like it was a fitment/head size issue maybe.

""Gaming"" headsets always mean you pay around 3 times the price for even worse quality, a lot of plastic and components that would count as budget level for any regular normal music/studio headset. Astros Amps are fine (and you would need one anyway) but I heavily recommend using one of such amps in combination with a quality non ""gaming"" headset. I did the same a few years ago and was blown away about the sound quality. You can combine regular headsets with a mic and get the same exact features you would get from regular gaming headsets, but with a sound that is unmatched. btw: that gaming basically means more expensive for the same thing could be seen in companies like Philips, who had gaming headsets that were actually the exact same models they sold without the tag, but for 3-4 times the price. Its pretty extreme what's happening in this segment but people usually have no comparison so they pay 300-400$ for ""premium"" gaming headsets without knowing, that the same Audi quality would cost them less then 80€, but also grants them high quality double straps and real cushions instead of the ultra cheap fake leather most have.",Seitenwerk,1

before i got this one i tried many others and they had even bigger issues from the moment i started using them, so i send them back. the wireless headset market seems to be pretty garbage, so i guess its not that bad of a headset. 300€ is just too much for something that is good when it works, but barely works.",kriegnes,1

The bass still has a bit excessive presence, which is expected & even ideal for gaming headphones. There's a really weird peak in the high mids that might be designed for footsteps or something, but it's hella annoying for music.

The worst part is that the band on the top is a huge downgrade and the headphones are so small that I can't tell if they tried to change from over-ear to on-ear since my ears don't fit in there, which reduces comfort. These things won't stop falling off my head.

People comment on these being less bassy than other gaming headphones because they are, but that doesn’t mean the. bass response is good. It’d be fine if it didn’t drown out others sounds as much.

I bought the wireless and tested it both wired and wireless, with and without noise cancellation.

This sounded less tinny out of the box for sure, but the sounds is still pretty bad all things considered. It really fits the gaming headphone lineup in that way. They have a huge boost that I thought was for footsteps, but it seemed to make gunfire obnoxiously loud.

They are good-ish as far as gaming headphones go, but that’s not saying much. They should be $150 cheaper and the issues with the band not being sturdy enough as well as the earcups being terribly awkward still remain.

I generally don’t recommend this headphone, but I’d bet that landing an HD6XX on Drop and getting an external microphone connected to it lands someone in a better spot at the same price-point. I’m sure there are also closed-back options around $200 that beat these as well.",BaileyPlaysGames,1

I've seen lots of others on here with a multitude of problems with their peripherals. Personally, have only had 2 problems. The design of the Arctis Nova Pro Wireless can be literally irritating due to the ANC mic that protrudes from the inside of the earcup. Usually only a problem for those with big ears (hand raised here). That can be solved with a purchase from Wicked Cushions. 

The other problem was a strange firmware glitch. For some reason one of the firmware updates to the headset did something to the HID programming in Windows 11 and caused the headset and dac to be unrecognizable. That was fixed by doing the old ""Uninstall all usb's in Device manager and restart."" My problems were easy to fix but who knows what will happen to you. I've had my headset for a little over a year and it has been performing well, other than what I mentioned. 

I personally think they are still worth the buy, especially due to their features. I also think they sound better than the ASTRO A50s. 


TL;DR- I think they're worth the purchase. Just know that your milage may vary. Also if you got big ears, just buy some Wicked Cushions.",Mdos828,2

Physically, it's great. I did have to buy bigger ear cups from wicked cushions because the ANC driver or whatever it is that sticks out of the headset is really painfully for my ear after an hour or two. 

I think something is going wrong with either my PC or the software, I don't know anymore. 

I played a lot of Overwatch and when 2 came out my headset just stopped working with it. I thought it was the game. For months I couldn't communicate through VOIP. 

Then the same thing started happening with Warzone. No one in my party could hear me unless I used discord. But some were on consoles. Eventually I figured out I have to mess with each games voice chat settings, go into windows audio settings and change things there as well. Every time. 

I also have to unplug and plug it back in every time I want to use it to chat when I first sit down to game. 

In windows setting I have to have it on Arctis Nova Pro Wireless instead of Steelseries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless or whatever it is. Sometimes GG won't recognize it and I have to mess with settings to get it to recognize the headset. Then end up having to settle for Arctis Nova Pro Wireless in the GG selection because Steelseries Arctis Nova Pro isn't an option and that makes me feel like I'm not getting any advantages from the software. 

I tried troubleshooting with support and when nothing worked they sent me a new headset and since I used their RMA process to get a headset in the meantime, I was charged $350 and would be refunded once I destroyed the old headset. 

When I received the new one no one would answer my emails for a month. So iahd that charge on my card the whole time. Eventually someone gave me the next steps to destroy my old one, which felt shitty. Then I got the refund. And the new one still has the same issues. 

When I asked for more troubleshooting no one responded. When I asked again after they sent an automated follow up email, no one responded. 

It's left a bad taste in my mouth and I'm disappointed. I'd either go either Arctis Pro Wirless I never had an issue with those. Or another brand entirely.",BludOfTheFold,4

What I was referring to was the number of issues I've noticed between both headsets in my limited experience with both.  The biggest issue with the Nova Pro Wireless is Sonar.  The entire software system around the Nova Pro Wireless is a giant pile of steaming garbage.  Let's ignore the useless ANC and regression of the base station as far as usability and build quality. 

Maybe you can make the argument that certain gaming situations the Nova Pro Wireless is better at giving you directional awareness and more intentional boost to footstep volume etc, but at the end of the day I'm wearing a headset for way more than just playing a game for an hour or two.  The Maxwells play better sounding music, thanks to the far better tuning and excellent planar drivers.  The Nova Pro Wireless is a muddy mess and lacks resolution overall.  It's not even a comparison.  The mic is a similar situation.  

The worst part is that the Arctis Nova Pro Wireless is a regression in so many ways from the last gen headset it replaced.  At least with the Maxwell I can listen to music with properly tuned drivers and take meetings with a decent sounding mic, all while being able to rely on welded joints instead of plastic ones. 

Neither headset is perfect, but you are crazy if you think that the build quality of the Maxwell is somehow inferior to the Arctis Nova Pro Wireless, and that the sound quality, all things considered, somehow tilts in favor of Steelseries, because it doesn't.",bigdbag999,1

The planars are obviously very nice.  Also, those joints you speak of were replaced with metal, of which I can easily take a picture, to address previous gen issues.   Do I know for sure build quality is better on novas? No.   Without specs in front of me I can't be certain.   I can make a pretty educated guess though.   Despite being far more mass produced, having having a larger community that loves to complain,  and being out far longer, I've seen far less build qc complaints on novas, than penrose, maxwell, and mobious.  Factoring the love for steelsteeries reddit whining, community size, and time since release, I'd go with a hypothesis that the novas likely have better build quality.   Now, don't get me wrong, I wouldn't recommend against audeze.... they clearly know how to get wonderful audio.... I'd simply recommend getting an extended warranty, like I would with anything else.   Now if this rubs you the wrong way, that just tells me you're a massive fanboy.   None of these companies are without flaw.... doesn't mean avoid them, just means protect yourself.",ShoddyButterscotch59,1

Three pairs of the Arctis pro wireless and one Arctis Nova pro Wireless.
We use the Arctis pro for movies on UHD Blurays and streaming with Nvidia shield tv pro , also for couch co-op on PS5,  nintendo switch (with 4k gamer+) and Xbox series S.
All goes via spdif from the tv so that's how we get all those working, this way we get the DTS headphones X to work with everything coming out the TV.
They are amazing sounding if you make your own EQ settings for movies and games, and as we daisy chain two pairs (the other 3rd one is for our bedroom tv) you can make your own EQ without having to think about the others, this goes for volumes and general settings too.
It's an incredible that it even works.
They all have wicked cushions padZ for better isolation and sound, the og cushions are trash Imho.

The Arctis Nova pro Wireless I use exclusively for PS5 when I'm going in solo, the 3D tempest in these cans is ridiculously good,var least since Sony updated the 3d sonics with Dolby Atmos support, but I got to say, I upgraded the ear cushions recently and I've had a much better sound experience since. I bought the wicked cushions freeze Hybrid cushions and it's incredible what they did, the passive noise canceling alone is worth it but with the Active NC on it's a full blown dream come true.
I was just about to buy the Audeze Maxwell too but now, I'm staying put saving 400$ in the process.

So there for multi console use,
The Arctic pro Wireless is the answer.
For one or two console use, the Arctis Nova pro is your answer.
Both sound amazing but the edge goes to the Nova pro Wireless because it really has better mid response and deeper bottom response.

The best antenna is on the 2015 version, the 2017 version has a good range but connection drops on mine and the 2019 version has the worst antenna, shortest range but is the best overall machine.
We have 2 Artist Pro wireless connected to a Spdif splitter, both get  virtual surround DTS/Dolby 7.1 from the TV Spdif out into the slitter and then into an Avantree Orbit then out to the Arctis pro wireless headsets.

What I have noticed is that if you use an USB 3 disc for more space it screws the Bluetooth signal, so maybe use an extender and then try again. IBM did a full investigation on how usb 3 devices bugs out wifi and Bluetooth signals if too close

Typically you can check reviews for top products in a category and if enough places say one is the best or second best it's typically fairly accurate.

With gaming headsets I find the top ones are legit straight up dog shit.

Last year I bought 5 different ones via Amazon as they don't give AF about returns and I don't give AF about their costs for having to restock.

All of them were top rated and all of them sounded terrible for surround sound and mic quality.

I ended up getting the next model up of my Logitech ones which ended up being the G935.

To this day I've yet to find a better headset for surround sound simulation in shooters and other games.

It's pinpoint with a killer mic and amazing audio quality.

It's a bummer because I want to find something better as the battery seems to die after a year where it drains much quicker but nothing else seems to best it.

TLDR. - gaming headsets are stupid and all review sites are clearly paid and full of shit. Just get G935's by Logitech.",SpacedDuck,1

So I recently picked these up and agree with the side tone issues you point out and thanks for the heads up on the Bluetooth staying on even when it is turned off.  I have discovered one thing that helps with the sidetone issues which I believe to be rooted in the noise cancellation feature of the headset.  So yep, just turn off the noise cancellation by double clicking the power button and your sidetone will finally sound good.  

I originally bought these for my wife as I had the Arctis Pro Wireless headset and she always wanted one.  In the end, she liked the way my Arcis Pro Wireless fit better so now I am using the Nova Pro Wireless lol.   The battery life issues you are dealing with I haven't run into yet, and they seem to be lasting longer than my Arctis Pro wireless batteries were but then again I might not be using Bluetooth as much as you are. 

For those curious, I don't see a ton of difference between the Arctis Pro Wireless and the Nova Pro Wireless outside of a different feel(not really better or worse).  Though I will say you need to adjust the filters heavily to make the nova pro sound decent.  Oh and for those who have trouble with your Arctis Pro Wireless disconnecting because of wireless interference.  The Nova Pro Wireless handles it a little bit better by not disconnecting persay.  The audio just gets super robotic during times of high interference.",ShoreXShot,3

Also they have to realize you're also paying for a ton of features..... If they're only worried about audio, you go with audeze, in they price range.   If you want  an all arounder, you go with something like these.  I've also had issues with some features, and for me, instead of complaining, I researched.... it's a learning curve to use them all, but as I figure them out, they're functioning as they should.",ShoddyButterscotch59,2

I have the Nova 7, not the Nova Pro so can't compare everything completely, but one key difference is that the Nova 7 has the fabric pads. I do have a set of the leather pads on order directly from Steelseries, they should come in a couple of days. I'm hoping they provide a better feeling seal, and that they can keep my ears a bit cooler potentially. 

I do really want to love this headset though, because from the ones I've actually tried myself it's got the best set of features, and I do actually quite like the software. There aren't many that seem to tick every box I'm after otherwise.

The other headset I'm currently trying is the Razer Barracuda X 2022, and it's just okay. Doesn't sound great, does put more pressure on top of my head than the Steelseries one does, is cheaper, but has fewer features.

But in general there making a wired headset that does compete with the other overpriced stuff from companies like astro/logitech/razer/etc.

They make a $100, that is the barebones product they make. Then they add some gimmicky bullshit like hi res certification and other stuff. That brings it to a sell price of $120, then they add a (what they charge) $130 usb soundcard. Which brings it to $250, this price also includes stuff like E sport sponsorships, software development, marketing, sale headroom, and more.

Then they make it wireless which they feel is worth charging an extra $100isd for.

At the end of the day for what your getting it's the same as other brands. It's just not all brands end up making this type of super feature inflated product. I think this type of product is stupid and not worth people's money.

But it's not crazy in terms of what the market sells stuff for. The gaming market in general pushed this inflated garbage. Look at any gaming brands top mouse and keyboard. There over priced garbage. Like corsair mechs which are super low quality but cost an arm and a leg.

The issue isn't steelseries top end gaming headsets. The issue is top end gaming products as a whole. There over inflated junk 90% of the time.

Only got to listen to the wireless model for about 20min. My unit won't be in for over a month.

In general sound wise it's not going to match the price. That's just not how gaming headsets or wireless headsets work. In general there pretty much all $100 headsets with features injected in and made wireless.

I expected the mic to be on par with the arctis pro mic.

What platform were you on and if pc did you have any sonar settings applied?

The a40 isn't that good of a headphone. But I do think overall it's maybe a but better vs the Nova wired. I'll have to pull my a40 out and directly compare. Because based on memory there pretty close sound quality wise.",LifelongCaboose,1

I wouldn't recommend it over the mh751. In general if you want a step up from the mh751. Go open back or get a headphone and a seperate mic. Or else your not really upgrading.

[OLD Reddit guide for more info on some of these (CLICK THIS LINK TO VIEW THE EDITED OLD GUIDE)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifelongCaboose/comments/kq00im/12a_lifelongcabooses_wireless_gaming/)

**Index (READ FIRST)**

1. **Wireless Gaming:** Not a Sound Style but a bonus guide. Sort of different than before but mostly the same. If you are not willing to sacrifice quality for wireless then turn away now. But if you for your own reason need wireless and are willing to sacrifice value and quality then this list will have the best of the worse options that may not be amazing but will still be decent. But know that your options will be limited and don't expect to be able to get amazing  ""Pure FPS"" performance or amazing tonal balance out of any of these.
2. **Alpha Value:** This is the Alpha Version of my grade ranking for headphones. This will change over time.
3. **Grades:** You will see every headphone/headset has two grades. The **1st Grade** being its **Tonal Grade**, this is the grade for how well its sound signature is tonally balanced. The **2nd Grade** is its **Tech Grade**, so all things outside of the frequency response, staging, imaging, separation, detail, dynamics, etc.
4. **PLEASE DO NOT COMPARE CLOSED-BACK RANKS WITH OPEN-BACK ONES AT THIS TIME!**
5. **Rankings are not everything:** Which is why Notes and Sound Signatures are important, but you must view the full guide to see those.
6. **Sound Signature VS Sound Style:** Sound Signature is the tuning of the frequency response. Sound Style is my term for the different categories I put headphones in for gaming.
7. **EQ/VSS:** If you need to use some light eq to help, go for it just be careful. Maybe even Virtual Surround Sound(VSS) if you can't position with stereo. I don't recommend VSS but some need it.
8. **External USB/XLR Mic:** If you plan to buy an XLR/USB mic for gaming please get a Dynamic mic, it will cancel out background noise better. (Don't buy a Yeti/quadcast/snowball)
9. **IMPORTANT:** Names with a bold **(X)** at the end of their name mean I don't recommend these that highly but may be good for the right person.
10. **IMPORTANT:** Wireless headsets have a lower lifespan and are not as easy to repair meaning once there dead they become E-Waste.
11. **Wired Use:** If they offer a passive out it will not only sound worse than the wireless connection but also worse than a true wired version.
12. **Latency:** Ideally you want below 60ms. Under 35ms is pretty much latency-free. Under 60ms is low latency. Under 110ms is ok for casual use. Over that is bad.
13. **EQ:** If you use a good parametric EQ not the crappy one included with most software suites, you can get good tonal balance out of these but it won't make the technical performance any better.

If you have any questions please respond to this comment. This is a premade message manually sent by me (not a bot).

But if you for your own reason need wireless and are willing to sacrifice value and quality then this list will have the best of the worse options that may not be amazing but will still be decent. But know that your options will be limited and don't expect to be able to get amazing  ""Pure FPS"" performance or amazing tonal balance out of any of these.
2. **Alpha Value:** This is the Alpha Version of my grade ranking for headphones. This will change over time.
3. **Grades:** You will see every headphone/headset has two grades. The **1st Grade** being its **Tonal Grade**, this is the grade for how well its sound signature is tonally balanced. The **2nd Grade** is its **Tech Grade**, so all things outside of the frequency response, staging, imaging, separation, detail, dynamics, etc.
4. **PLEASE DO NOT COMPARE CLOSED-BACK RANKS WITH OPEN-BACK ONES AT THIS TIME!**
5. **Rankings are not everything:** Which is why Notes and Sound Signatures are important, but you must view the full guide to see those.
6. **Sound Signature VS Sound Style:** Sound Signature is the tuning of the frequency response. Sound Style is my term for the different categories I put headphones in for gaming.
7. **EQ/VSS:** If you need to use some light eq to help, go for it just be careful. Maybe even Virtual Surround Sound(VSS) if you can't position with stereo. I don't recommend VSS but some need it.
8. **External USB/XLR Mic:** If you plan to buy an XLR/USB mic for gaming please get a Dynamic mic, it will cancel out background noise better. (Don't buy a Yeti/quadcast/snowball)
9. **IMPORTANT:** Names with a bold **(X)** at the end of their name mean I don't recommend these that highly but may be good for the right person.
10. **IMPORTANT:** Wireless headsets have a lower lifespan and are not as easy to repair meaning once there dead they become E-Waste.
11. **Wired Use:** If they offer a passive out it will not only sound worse than the wireless connection but also worse than a true wired version.
12. **Latency:** Ideally you want below 60ms. Under 35ms is pretty much latency-free. Under 60ms is low latency. Under 110ms is ok for casual use. Over that is bad.
13. **EQ:** If you use a good parametric EQ not the crappy one included with most software suites, you can get good tonal balance out of these but it won't make the technical performance any better.

If you have any questions please respond to this comment. This is a premade message manually sent by me (not a bot).

That confirms basically what I thought to be true, that MH75X range is truly a stellar one since they are also based off the Takstar's, a studio-reference headphone on a budget. I've been blindly recommending these babies to anyone because it gets so much right, just sad to see that these expensive headsets don't really do anything of note.

IMO, I’ve thoroughly enjoyed the sound that I’ve gotten out of my XTs (I also have my DT 770s and 990s with a SoundBlaster X3 dac/amp). If they don’t work for you then that’s fine, but sound (specifically headphones) is hard to be objective since everyone will perceive it differently.

It's just how it sounds.

Sound guys graph shows its pretty uneven and far from neutral. Also remember sound guys uses a B&K rig and does no on head testing nor do they list how they get there measurement or if it's an average or an ideal fit. 

The ear gain are very placement dependant and on a normal head in a normal listening position it will sound closer to the H3 non pro hybrid graph.

Bass is still muddy and bleeds hard into the mids, but where the H3 at least has the right shape with elevated sub bass this doesnt and it rolls off.

Treble is fairly forward and over 10k sounds fairly dead and lacks air.

It's overall super limited by the fact that is the low end H3 driver and the Pro version did nothing to change that. So unless they release a new model with a new driver it's going to remain a v shaped, low resolution $70 headset with features to inflate the price sadly.

I also find the H3 comfort mediocre. H6 pro line is more comfortable and neither are as comfortable as the mh751 which also sounds better.

But only because ""Studio headphone"" is mostly marketing fluff. Most headphones marketed as a studio headphone often don't mean in terms of sound as most of them don't have a sound that matches any target or reference. Pro 82 which the mh751 is based on is definitely no reference. But it is a good headphone.

They got super luck picking a good oem headphone. I assume they say all the takstar pro 80 rebrand and decided to get in on it and picked the newer model. Which is good because the pro 80 is hella out of date now. Pro 82 rebrand are great. I know from talking to them they seemed super proud of it. Sadly attempt 2 with the mh600 line was a flop Imo. They rebranded another takstar but this time it wasnt so good. 

But mh751 Super good value.

Do note. Cooler master rebranded an existing headphone that was already a good value.

Steelseries are trying to build there's from the ground up. They have been trying to do this with a wireless headset since 2013. So there $100 headset gets a $100 dac and $50 in marketing fluff and software. Then they add $100 for wireless and anc, but remove the dac, and add a baystation. 

The cooler master mh751 is smart because it has no added bullshit to inflate its price. Just a good quality headset. Vs the Nova which is trying to offer everything.

Honestly alot of these gaming companies would be better off selling rebrand. But I love seeing companies try to innovate. An it's awesome to see how far Steelseries has come with the mud monster that was the H wireless. 

So in general, these headsets like the Nova are not expensive headsets. The headset is an entry level headset, it's all the stuff around it that makes it cost so much. And Imo that kills the value and makes it just overpriced junk. This is pretty much gaming headsets and consumer electronics in a nut shell. 

Buy an Mh751, fulla 3e, use peace and eq APO along with any free vss. Boom you spent less and have a better product. Because you bought each individual part from a company that does that thing well. Rather than 1 company trying to swiss army knife it.

V shaped doesn't mean bad. The tuning is bad ecause the bass is so incredibly overblown, upper mids are shouty and way to forward. And treble is very uneven. For the closed back model.

Tuning is too elevated, with too much focus in the mid bass making it a but muddy.

But in terms of actually driver dynamics they lack punch and slam. They hit like a wet noodle. And no tuning change fixed that. The bass is just loose and dynamicly weak. Like some of the worse bass dynamics on any headphone. 

Mids are also super grainy and lacking any detail, this goes all the way into the treble which doesn't know what detail even is. It's a joke. 

The sound on this truly is maybe the worse sound you can get over $200. It's a shock how it got approved.

You should understand, you likely have a fairly normal head with normal sized ears. The sort of person who finds a DT770 or XM4 quite comfortable? But for many, headsets with smaller earpads can be literally unwearable. Those are the people you’ll find constantly posting here about comfort. Comfort >> sound for these people. I cannot stress this enough.

The biggest offender in this sub is something like the Penrose, which is an absolute joke - or possible even a torture device.

SG’s measurements are on top end B&K rig. Extrapolating against many of the other headphones they’ve measured with the same rig gives a fairly accurate idea of how these are tuned. I think you’re underselling them massively.

Comfort isn't as simple as big head means ouch. It's far more nuanced than that. If pressure spots, shape of the ear cups mixed with clamp force and clamp design, distribution and so much more.

Extrapolating measurement from one rig to another isn't exactly how Hats work. Especially when sound guys targets have no accuracy really as it's not an industry standard or anything. You can't just look at a headphone on 2 different rigs and extrapolate how all others will sound on both as they have vastly different acoustic interactions. Again, like with the comfort thing, it's just not that simple. Let alone pinna differences, bass differences from head to head. 

Penrose, alpha wireless, barracuda pro, are all better sounding products.

The H3 pro hybrid may be comfort able (uneven clamp distribution), and has alot of features. But it's dynamic dull, it's tuned poorly, very low resolution, large placement variation, vastly overpriced. Sound wise it's just nothing special and doesn't come close to sounding close to its price point.

An if all you care about is comfort over sound, there are many poor sounding cheap headsets that are comfortable. The H3 pro doesn't do anything to justify its price tag.",LifelongCaboose,1

Both of these things cannot be true! Even little Techne on YT has to use wicked cushions on his Penrose to make 'em bearable.

Also, I mentioned extrapolating data between different headphones measured by Soundguys on the same rig. Which happens to be a $40,000 piece of kit from B&K.Yes, Harman was derived on a GRAS setup, but SG's compensation graph provides a rough approximation of how their B&K target compares to Harman ([here](https://sgatlas.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/consumer-curve-vs-harman-1000x656.jpg)).

Anyway, I don't want to talk in circles. I still think discounting the H3Pro Hybrid is silly, but it is strange/unlikely that you've just had two bad units.

I'll contact Oratory1990 about measuring my set so we can get some Gras measurements for comparisons sake. They ARE a little muddy and a bit bright, but nothing too offensive to my ears. Certainly not for gaming anyway.  


\*edit\* AGREED they are overpriced. True of most wireless kit nowadays. I got mine for 45% off on Prime day, so this would definitely be affecting my view.",my2dumbledores,1

But I have no issue with comfort on it. The Mobius has been my go to portable for years now. The clamp eases up alot.

Yes they attempt to offer a approximation of Harman but it does not do a great job of it. Even Harman is struggling to get a good Harman curve for 5128. Though there are 2 people who will have a much better curve soon. But sound guys struggle to produce transparent measurements constantly. Doesn't matter that they spent $40,000 if the research behind there target and constancy of there methodology is lacking a bit.

Oratory1990 would happily measure your unit if you send it his way. He now uses Gras kemar, an I do fear there may be some seal issues, with the epos H line. But they does tons of seatings thankfully.

Sadly I couldn't get a long term unit in so I couldn't measure it, but I did do a long enough listen.",LifelongCaboose,1

Oh yeah, I have every pad known to man (Dekoni, Yaxi, Brainwavz, WC's and more) but they all just gather dust now. I'm yet to find one which didn't completely destroy the tonal balance.  
BUT, it also shows how people will often priorities comfort over sound. We really need to champion headsets which can manage both.

Ooer. Who? Linked to Linus? I imagine he's hired someone decent.",my2dumbledores,1

But yes, the LTT hire, Sam V is very knowledgeable. He's actually the guy who built the Rtings flaw but interesting headphone testing methodology. An with limitless resources this new test methodology he's developing will be great. Once he finally gets his 5128 in (currently he's only doing on head stuff). I have tons of faith in him.",LifelongCaboose,2
